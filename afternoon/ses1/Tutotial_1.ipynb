Trump, suggesting that he and other conservatives had plenty of time to assess their options. “Well, listen, this is a choice every voter is going to have to make,” Mr. Cruz told Glenn Beck, a radio host who endorsed Mr. Cruz during his bid. “It is not a choice that we as voters have to make today.” Mr. Cruz also did not entirely rule out re-entering the race “if there is a path to victory,” allowing — perhaps half-jokingly — that he would reassess his plans if he were to somehow prevail in Nebraska’s Republican primary on Tuesday night. “Well, I’m not holding my breath,” Mr. Cruz said, laughing. “My assumption is that that will not happen.” But, he added, he only left the race last week because after his blowout loss in Indiana, “I didn’t see a viable path to victory.” “If that changes,” he said, “we will respond accordingly.” He did say that the formation of any third party of like-minded conservatives was not “very likely.” After initially embracing his rival last year as a worthy addition to the Republican field, Mr. Cruz slogged through an often brutal primary fight against Mr. Trump, who by turns insulted Mr. Cruz’s wife and his father, questioned his eligibility for the presidency and branded him “Lyin’ Ted.” Though many former supporters and longtime Trump critics, including former Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, have recently lined up behind Mr. Trump, several members of Mr. Cruz’s team have remained sharply critical of the presumptive nominee. And it is clear that Mr. Cruz plans to pursue a crucial role at the Republican convention in Cleveland on July 18-21. In an email sent on Sunday to pro-Cruz convention delegates, a top aide to Mr. Cruz, Ken Cuccinelli, said it was “still possible to advance a conservative agenda” and influence the Republican platform and convention rules. (Mr. Cruz told supporters on a conference call that he planned to attend the convention.) On Tuesday, Mr. Cruz offered only the faintest of praise for Mr. Trump, spending much of the interview accusing the news media of fueling his rival’s rise. “There’s no doubt about the power of celebrity,” Mr. Cruz said. “And by any measure, Donald Trump is a phenomenon.” He also called himself “a little old-fashioned” in thinking that Americans should be able to “look up to our president.” Jonathan Martin contributed reporting. Mark Paustenbach National Press Secretary & Deputy Communications Director Democratic National Committee W: 202.863.8148 paustenbachm@dnc.org', '\\'Self-funded\\' Donald Trump preparing to seek big-donor money By JULIE BYKOWICZ May. 13, 2016 1:41 PM EDT LAS VEGAS (AP) — The billionaire presidential candidate who prides himself on paying his own way and bashed his competition for relying on political donors now wants their money — and lots of it. Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, recently hired a national finance chairman, scheduled his first fundraiser and is on the cusp of signing a deal with the Republican Party that would enable him to solicit donations of more than $300,000 apiece from supporters. His money-raising begins right away. The still-forming finance team is planning a dialing-for-dollars event on the fifth floor of Trump Tower in New York, and the campaign is at work on a fundraising website focused on small donations. In addition to a May 25 fundraiser at the Los Angeles home of real estate developer Tom Barrack, he\\'ll hold another soon thereafter in New York. The political newcomer faces a gargantuan task: A general election campaign can easily run up a $1 billion tab. For the primary race, Trump spent a tiny fraction of that amount — he\\'s estimated $50 million of his own money, plus about $12 million from donors who sought his campaign out on their own. Trump told The Associated Press in an interview this week that he will spend minimally on a data operation that can help identify and turn out voters. And he\\'s betting that the media\\'s coverage of his rallies and celebrity personality will reduce his need for pricey television advertising. Yet he acknowledged that the general-election campaign may cost \"a lot.\" To help raise the needed money, he tapped Steven Mnuchin, a New York investor with ties in Hollywood and Las Vegas but no political fundraising experience. \"To me this is no different than building a business, and this is a business with a fabulous product: Donald Trump,\" Mnuchin said in an interview at a financial industry conference in Las Vegas. Trump\\'s new national finance chairman said prospective donors are \"coming out of the woodwork\" and he\\'s been fielding emails and phone calls from people he hasn\\'t heard from in 20 years. More experienced fundraisers are coming aboard, too, such as Eli Miller of Washington, Anthony Scaramucci of New York and Ray Washburn of Dallas. All three helped raise money for candidates Trump defeated in the primary. To convey the amount of work needed to vacuum up money, Scaramucci, part of 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney\\'s finance team, recently shared Romney\\'s old fundraising calendar with Trump. He said Trump was receptive to a schedule that has 50 to 100 fundraisers over the summer. Scaramucci said he didn\\'t expect Trump to grovel for donors. \"But is he going to say thank you and be appreciative? Of course. He\\'s very good one-on-one. He\\'s a hard guy not to like.\" Trump\\'s dilemma: By asking for money, he could anger supporters who love his assertion that he\\'s different from most politicians because he isn\\'t beholden to donors. He\\'s tried to navigate these tricky waters by saying he wants only to raise money to benefit the party and help elect other Republicans. But his planned joint fundraising agreement with Republican officials also provides a direct route to his own campaign coffers. Such an arrangement could work like this: For each large contribution, the first $2,700 or $5,400 goes to Trump\\'s campaign, the next $33,400 goes to the Republican National Committee, similar amounts could go to national party accounts and the rest is divided evenly among various state parties the candidate selects. Democrat Hillary Clinton set up such a victory committee in September, and it had collected $61 million by the end of March. She also counts on several super PACs that. They\\'ve landed million-dollar checks from her friends and supporters and already scheduled $130 million in TV, radio and internet ads leading up to Election Day. Trump is only now beginning to turn his attention to this kind of big money. A decision on how fully to embrace outside groups is fraught with possible charges of hypocrisy, since he has called them \"corrupt.\" Still, wealthy Trump supporters have several options — and megadonors are beginning to line up. Sheldon Adelson, a billionaire Las Vegas casino owner who was the largest donor of the 2012 presidential race, wrote in a Washington Post editorial this week that he endorses Trump and is urging \"those who provide important financial backing\" to do the same. Libertarian billionaire Peter Thiel, who co-founded PayPal and pumped millions of dollars into Ron Paul\\'s presidential bid four years ago, recently signed on as a California delegate for Trump. And billionaire oil investor T. Boone Pickens said this week he intends to help finance Trump\\'s effort. He\\'s invited officials from one of the pro-Trump super PACs to his Texas ranch next month. That entity, Great America PAC, has struggled to get off the ground but hopes to raise $15 million to $20 million in the next few months, said its chief fundraiser, Eric Beach. The group recently brought on Ronald Reagan\\'s campaign manager Ed Rollins, whom Trump has praised. On Thursday, another pro-Trump super PAC emerged. Doug Watts, former communications director for Ben Carson\\'s 2016 bid, started a group called the Committee for American Sovereignty with an advisory board that include former Trump resorts executive Nicholas Ribis Sr. and longtime GOP donor Kenneth Abramowitz. The group aims to raise $20 million before the GOP convention in July. One Trump emissary to the world of major donors is billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who made calls to Pickens and others to gauge their interest in Trump. Some are biting, either because of support for Trump or a desire to keep Clinton out of office. Among the latter group is Stanley Hubbard, a Minnesota broadcast billionaire who spent money trying to \"stop Trump.\" Having failed in that quest, he said he\\'s prepared to write a check to stop Clinton. ___ Associated Press writer Jill Colvin contributed to this report.

RNC Chairman Reince Priebus will sit in the meeting, too. A second meeting including Ryan, Trump and a larger roster of GOP leadership will follow. Attendees will include Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.), Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.), and Deputy Whip Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) There will be no press availability after, but Ryan will do an on-camera availability later that morning, the source said. Trump has no plans to meet with Trump endorsers at this time, according to two additional sources familiar with this schedule. But supporters will meet Friday morning with the Trump campaign’s Hill liaisons to discuss how the meeting went and next steps forward.', 'Wasserman Schultz on Sanders\\' response to Nevada chaos: \\'Anything but acceptable\\' POLITICO By Daniel Strauss 05/17/16 10:38 PM EDT Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz panned Bernie Sanders\\' response to reports of violence at the Nevada Democratic state convention over the weekend, calling it \"anything but acceptable.\" Wasserman Schultz was speaking on CNN Tuesday night, after a day in which Sanders campaign exchanged pointed public statements with the DNC and the Nevada Democratic party over allegations that Sanders\\' campaign encouraged \"extra-parliamentary behavior—indeed, actual violence\" at the convention, in the words of the Nevada Democratic Party. The DNC chairwoman was asked if she had spoken with Sanders directly on Tuesday about the convention. She said she had not, but that Sanders\\' 10-minute discussion with Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) was sufficient. \"I was comfortable that one conversation was enough,\" Wasserman Schultz said during an interview on CNN Tuesday night. \"Unfortunately, the senator\\'s response was anything but acceptable. It certainly did not condemn the supporters for the violence and added more fuel to the fire.\" After the DNC and the Nevada Democratic Party said that Sanders needed to publicly denounce his supporter\\'s conduct at the convention, the Vermont senator accused party leaders of favoring Clinton over his campaign. \"If the Democratic Party is to be successful in November, it is imperative that all state parties treat our campaign supporters with fairness and the respect that they have earned,\" Sanders said in his statement. Chaos ensued last Saturday in Nevada after Sanders\\' supporters became incensed at the idea that the senator was being treated unfairly in the delegate allocation process.', 'Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz downplayed tensions between Sanders and Clinton, whose rivalry has become increasingly nasty in recent weeks. \"Regardless of the intensity of what\\'s played out here ... we are going to be unified,\" she declared.', \"RNC's Priebus Gathers Big GOP Donors, As Trump Indiana Win May Cement Nomination Fox Business // Charlie Gasparino Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus is telling donors that he now has a solid relationship with GOP front-runner Donald Trump, and has indicated that he believes that Trump could wrap up the nomination if he wins the Indiana primary on Tuesday, the FOX Business Network has learned. But Priebus also said that Trump’s best chance at becoming the GOP presidential candidate is if he attains the majority of the party’s delegates before the GOP’s July convention in Cleveland, Ohio and avoids a so-called open convention where delegates are free to switch to other candidates in a second or third ballot. Priebus made those comments in recent days during a series of private meetings with party fundraisers that have yet to be made public. Select groups of big money GOP donors huddled with the RNC chief after Trump’s resounding wins in the New York primary last week and Tuesday’s primaries where the real estate developer and reality television star swept five states. Trump is now closer to amassing a majority or 1,237 delates needed to win the nomination on the first ballot. Trump has 996 delegates compared to his main opponent, Texas Senator Ted Cruz’s 565 delegates. Ohio Governor John Kasich, the other remaining candidate vying for the GOP nod, has just 153 delegates. As Trump closes in on winning the GOP nomination, Priebus has been holding these gatherings in an effort to unify a divided party as the convention and the 2016 presidential election draws near. A spokeswoman for the RNC Lindsay Walters confirmed that the meetings took place, though she took issue with the notion that Priebus explicitly stated that Trump has the nomination locked up if he wins Indiana on Tuesday and its 57 delegates. “There are only 57 delegates in Indiana,” she said. “So it puts him a little bit below. You need 1237 bound delegates. Indiana does not get him there. It only gets him just below 1,000, he is still going to be short.” She did not deny Priebus’ description of his relationship with Trump, or his explanation of how the billionaire is less likely to win the nomination on a second or third ballot. Nor did she dispute the notion that Priebus is now working overtime to mend fences in a fractious party. Walters explained, “He’s calling for unity. He will rally behind the party whoever the nominee is. You have heard him echo the comments over and over again.” Despite his front-runner status, Trump’s unconventional campaign style—from his ad-libbed speeches to his penchant to demean opponents through name-calling—continues to rankle many party officials, including donors who will be called upon by RNC officials to fund the Republican effort to defeat likely Democratic Party nominee, Hillary Clinton, and other races that are up for grabs in the fall election. Many Republican donors worry that Trump’s poor ratings among women, for instance, will hurt the party’s chances to retain control of Congress—a point they made during the recent meetings with Priebus. Trump, meanwhile, has attempted to portray his campaign as an uphill battle to wrestle the nomination from party elites. He has attacked both the RNC and the party’s delegate system as rigged because in certain states delegates can switch their support to those candidates who have not won the popular vote. Cruz, for instance, has been able to pick up delegates in Louisiana even though Trump won the popular vote in the state’s primary because of such rules. Priebus, these people say, has been careful in the meetings not to criticize any specific candidate. He has stressed the need for party unity, underscoring the fractious condition of the GOP, and the difficultly he faces in mending fences as he prepares for a general election fight. Trump’s erratic style and lack of policy credentials (South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham recently attacked a foreign policy speech by Trump as “unnerving and pathetic”) are considered liabilities, but Cruz also has baggage. Former Republican House Speaker John Boehner recently lambasted Cruz as “Lucifer…a miserable son of a bitch,” for his style of governing while in the senate. One attendee said that Priebus made a point of telling donors that for all of Trump’s attacks against the party leadership, his relationship with Trump “is personally very good,” a point spokeswoman Walters confirmed. Priebus also said that in one meeting with the GOP front runner he urged Trump to assemble a more seasoned campaign team to understand the party election rules. Priebus took credit for Trump’s recent hiring of veteran political handlers, such as Paul Manafort, to guide him through the campaign as it reaches its final weeks. Maybe most startling to donors was Priebus’ prediction about the aftermath of a possible Trump victory in the upcoming Indiana primary. According to people present, Priebus indicated that he believes a Trump victory in the state will likely provide Trump with enough momentum to win the nomination. Indiana is a winner-take-all state, and the donors said that Priebus indicated through his comments that a win there for Trump would make it likely that he could win over the remaining delegates needed to take the nomination on the first ballot. But if Trump doesn’t get to 1,237, Priebus also explained to donors that he believes the advantage switches to Cruz’s favor given the Texas Senator’s strong ground game in maneuvering the delegate process and his inroads among important constituencies in the Republican Party including religious conservatives. Priebus also made it clear that he has no intentions to change party rules that call for the nominee to compile a majority of delegates, despite Trump’s public comments that whoever has a plurality should be given the nomination. “He said the party rules have been in place a long time and he has no intentions of changing them,” said another attendee.\", 'After tensions explode in Nevada, it’s time for Sanders to be honest with his supporters Washington Post By Editorial Board May 18 at 7:04 PM TENSIONS IN the Democratic presidential race exploded in Nevada over the weekend. Supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) shouted, cursed and threw chairs during a state party convention in which they failed to force rules changes they wanted. Even though they were attempting to get more delegates than the caucus results in the state suggested they deserved, they attacked the process as unfair. The state party chair subsequently received death threats against her and her family. Mr. Sanders responded with self-righteousness and hypocrisy. He released a statement in which he listed a series of procedural complaints about the Nevada convention, attacked the Democratic Party for not being inclusive enough and warned that “millions of Americans are outraged” and that “the political world is changing.” He offered a throwaway line, three paragraphs down, condemning his supporters’ hooliganism in a statement that mostly justified it. Mr. Sanders’s irresponsibility is sadly unsurprising. He has stirred up populist energy over the past several months with anti-corporate scapegoating and extravagant claims about policy. He has indulged and encouraged hyperbolic feelings that the country is badly adrift, that most of the nation agrees with a left-wing agenda but is trapped in a corrupt system, and that nothing but a political revolution will do. He has attracted some big, passionate crowds. But as he has lagged in votes, he increasingly has questioned the legitimacy of the process and encouraged his supporters to feel disenfranchised. The result is a toxic mix of unreason, revolutionary fervor and perceived grievance. What is particularly galling about the Sanders camp’s complaints of disenfranchisement is that Mr. Sanders has benefited or tried to benefit from a variety of sketchy quirks of the nominating process. He has claimed support for his cause in caucuses, which are quite exclusive, but he complains about closed primary elections, which are more inclusive. In Nevada, his supporters were trying to game the rules to get more delegates and got upset when they did not succeed. As veteran Nevada politics reporter Jon Ralston put it, “Despite their social media frothing and self-righteous screeds, the facts reveal that the Sanders folks disregarded rules, then when shown the truth, attacked organizers and party officials as tools of a conspiracy to defraud the senator of what was never rightfully his in the first place.” Mr. Sanders denies reality when he tells supporters he still has a plausible pathway to the Democratic presidential nomination. But passion cannot trump reality. It also cannot excuse violence, threats and attempts at mob rule. It is past time for Mr. Sanders to be honest with his supporters, before they take the campaign’s irresponsible ethos to greater extremes and thereby help ensure the election of Donald Trump.', 'Google to ban payday loan advertisements Washington Post By Andrea Peterson and Jonnelle Marte May 11 at 9:00 AM Google announced Wednesday that it will ban all payday loan ads from its site, bowing to concerns by advocates who say the lending practice exploits the poor and vulnerable by offering them immediate cash that must be paid back under sky-high interest rates. The decision is the first time Google has announced a global ban on ads for a broad category of financial products. To this point, the search giant has prohibited ads for largely illicit activities such as selling guns, explosives and drugs, and limited those that are sexually explicit or graphic in nature, for example. Critics of payday lenders say they hope the move by Google and other tech companies might undercut the business which finds huge numbers of willing customers on the internet. The move also shows the willingness of big tech companies to weigh in on critical policy issues -- and exert their power as the gateways for the internet. Facebook also does not display ads for payday loans. But others, such as Yahoo, still do. Consumers will still be able to find payday lenders from a Google search. But the ads that appear on the top and right-hand side of a search results page will not show marketing from the payday lending industry beginning on July 13. \"We’ll continue to review the effectiveness of this policy, but our hope is that fewer people will be exposed to misleading or harmful products,\" Google global product policy director David Graff said in a blog post about the change. Washington regulators, as well as a handful of states, have been trying to limit the activities of payday lenders by capping how much they can charge consumers in an interest rate. But the decisions by tech giants Facebook and Google – the two biggest websites on the planet – might have as much impact as any single regulation in restricting access to payday lenders. Industry officials, speaking generally of advertising restrictions placed on payday lenders, called the policies “discriminatory,” adding that some consumers may need access to the short-term loans if they can’t get credit them through a traditional bank. “Facebook and others are making a blanket assessment about the payday lending industry rather than discerning the good actors from the bad actors,” the Community Financial Services Association of America, a payday lending trade group, said in a statement. “This is unfair towards those that are legal, licensed lenders.” Millions of low-income Americans use the short-term loans to get cash quickly while planning to repay their balance once they get their next paycheck. But all too often, borrowers get caught in a vicious cycle where fees quickly mount and annual interest rates can be in the triple-digits. In many cases, this debt drama plays out online -- and starts with a search query. \"You search the internet when you need help -- and as a result you may give search engines some really sensitive information about your finances,\" explained Alvaro Bedoya, the executive director of Georgetown Law\\'s Center on Privacy & Technology. When those desperate searches return targeted ads for payday loans, lenders end up profiting from the weaknesses those people have shared, he said. But once a borrower has committed to an online payday loan, they may end up facing unexpected financial risks. According to a recent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau analysis, half of borrowers who took out online payday loans were later hit with an average of $185 worth of bank fees or penalties when a lender submitted automatic repayment requests they couldn\\'t afford. The CFPB is working on a proposed rule targeting the industry which it expects to unveil later this spring. The agency is considering rules that would limit the number of times consumers could rollover a loan, capping them at two or three loans total. The rules might also require lenders to verify consumers’ income and borrowing history to gauge their ability to pay back the loan. Google itself had previously taken some steps to limit payday loan ads. The decision to ban them outright came in part after pressure from a coalition of civil liberties, consumer protection, and privacy groups that reached out to the search giant about the issue late last year. The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights was one of those groups. “This new policy addresses many of the longstanding concerns shared by the entire civil rights community about predatory payday lending,\" Wade Henderson, the group\\'s president and chief executive, said in a statement. \"Low-income people and people of color have long been targeted by slick advertising and aggressive marketing campaigns to trap consumers into outrageously high interest loans.” To enforce the policy, those seeking to market financial products through Google\\'s sprawling advertising network will be required to disclose the length of the loan and the annual interest rate before they will be allowed to place ads. In addition to the broad payday loan ad ban, Google will not display ads from lenders who charge annual interest rates of 36 percent or more in the United States. The same standards will apply to sites that serve as middlemen who connect distressed borrowers to those lenders. That\\'s important because banning ads for payday loans themselves may not be enough, according to some advocates. \"If you type in a search term that indicates financial distress, most of the ads you\\'ll see will be for websites that are not the payday lenders themselves, but marketing companies who collect leads then auction them off to the lenders,\" said Aaron Rieke, one of the authors of a reporton online payday lending advertisements released by consulting firm Upturn last year. Google, of course, has also profited from those ads. Although they likely make up only a small fraction of the company\\'s staggering online advertising revenues -- which were more than $18 billion in the first quarter of this year -- banning them will mean the company is leaving dollars on the table. To advocates like Bedoya, that\\'s a good thing. \"Google is taking a principled stance here,\" he said. \"Hopefully, it\\'s one that will help set a new standard for search engines.\" Mark Paustenbach National Press Secretary & Deputy Communications Director Democratic National Committee W: 202.863.8148 paustenbachm@dnc.org', 'Great.

Bernie Sanders’ campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, on Monday criticized a Hillary Clinton campaign fundraising scheme that state party leaders told Politico has been used as a self-serving “money-laundering\" conduit. Despite Clinton’s pledges to rebuild state parties, Politico found that less than 1 percent of the $61 million raised by the Victory Fund has stayed in the state parties’ coffers. “Secretary Clinton is looting funds meant for the state parties to skirt fundraising limits on her presidential campaign,” Weaver said. “We think the Clinton campaign should let the state parties keep their fair share of the cash.” Sanders’ and Clinton’s primary campaigns both raised about $26 million in April, but Politico documented how the Hillary Victory Fund, a supposedly joint fundraising committee, has been exploited to inflate her presidential primary campaign. “Secretary Clinton has exploited the rules in ways that let her high-dollar donors like Alice Walton of Wal-Mart fame and the actor George Clooney and his super-rich Hollywood friends skirt legal limits on campaign contributions,” Weaver added. “If Secretary Clinton can\\'t raise the funds needed to run in a competitive primary without resorting to laundering, how will she compete against Donald Trump in a general election?” The Sanders campaign first raised questions about the arrangement in an April 18 letter from Brad Deutsch, the attorney for Sanders’ campaign, to U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the chair of the DNC. \"Hillary Clinton says that campaign finance reform is one of the most important issues facing our country but her campaign\\'s use of the Victory Fund to essentially launder money proves otherwise,\" Weaver said. \"You cannot exploit a broken campaign finance system one day and vow to get big money out of politics the next.\" Sanders last month raised money for three progressive Democratic candidates for the House of Representatives. Unlike the Hillary Victory Fund, every dollar went directly to helping the candidates. The senator has also raised significant sums for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. ### Paid for by Bernie 2016 PO Box 905 - Burlington, Vermont 05402, United States', 'The main difference between the two statements is the portion in yellow in the second one.

See here.', 'Bernie Sanders’s Defiance Strains Ties With Top Democrats New York Times By JEREMY W. PETERS and ALAN RAPPEPORT MAY 18, 2016 WASHINGTON — Senator Bernie Sanders’s relationship with the leadership of the Democratic Party and his colleagues on Capitol Hill was strained further on Wednesday as he and his campaign remained defiant over the way they say his success is being belittled and undermined by people in the party who are loyal toHillary Clinton. Whatever tolerance Democrats have for Mr. Sanders’s continuing his increasingly long-shot presidential bid was quickly evaporating, with some of his closest allies in the party suggesting his efforts to rein in his most unruly supporters was half-hearted. “Bernie and I have known each other for a long time,” said Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the minority leader and one of Mr. Sanders’ best friends in the Senate. “And I believe he is better than this.” Vice President Joe Biden also weighed in, saying that while Mr. Sanders is “a good guy,” he needed “to be more aggressive in speaking out.” The dispute centered around the Democratic state convention in Nevada over the weekend in which Mr. Sanders was denied the delegates he thought he had earned, a development that infuriated his supporters there and led some to throw chairs and later threaten the state party chairwoman. The Democratic Party of Nevada pushed back against the Sanders campaign’s criticism that the process wrongly deprived him of delegates, saying that “simple math” dictated the outcome and that Mr. Sanders was simply outnumbered. “Bernie Sanders’s campaign was not organized,” the party said in a statement, noting that nearly 500 of his seats at the convention were vacant because his supporters had failed to show up. National party leaders, such as the Democratic National Committee chairwoman,Debbie Wasserman Schultz, have also criticized how Mr. Sanders has handled the unrest in Nevada, adding to the frustration within his campaign. Mr. Sanders’s campaign manager took to cable news on Wednesday to assail the party and Ms. Schultz. “The chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, it is clear almost from the get-go she has been working against Bernie Sanders — there’s no doubt about it, for personal reasons,” Jeff Weaver, Mr. Sanders’s campaign manager, said of Ms. Wasserman Schultz on MSNBC. “She has been the divider and not really provided leadership that the Democratic Party needs,” Mr. Weaver added. Nowhere has the strain in the Democratic Party been more evident lately than in Mr. Sanders’s relationship with Mr. Reid. Few members of the Senate are closer to Mr. Sanders than Mr. Reid, who had tried to head off any confrontation by speaking personally with Mr. Sanders on Friday to stress the importance of not letting the state convention devolve into a messy fight over a handful of delegates. “If you want the two damn delegates, you can have them,” Mr. Reid told Mr. Sanders, according to someone with firsthand knowledge of the discussions between the two senators. Though Mr. Reid has endorsed Mrs. Clinton, he has said that he believes Mr. Sanders has earned a right to remain in the race. After the convention went awry, Mr. Reid and Mr. Sanders spoke again on Tuesday afternoon. Mr. Reid expressed dismay that Mr. Sanders’s supporters had acted so belligerently. A member of his own staff was at the convention and feared for her own safety, Mr. Reid said. He also said that the way Sanders supporters had been harassing Roberta Lange, the state party chairwoman — filling her voice mail with threatening, obscene messages and showing up at her Las Vegas restaurant in protest — was over the line. Mr. Sanders said he agreed and believed that the violence should be condemned. But when he released his statement on Tuesday night, which made only a passing reference to the violence at the convention, a perplexed Mr. Reid told his staff that he thought the gesture was “silly” and beneath Mr. Sanders, according to the person who spoke with Mr. Reid. The two senators have not spoken since. Mr. Sanders appeared to be taken somewhat by surprise at the way the Nevada melee was being portrayed, and how negatively it was reflecting on his campaign. Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, Mr. Sanders’s lone endorser in the Senate, said in an interview that he had spoken with Mr. Sanders on Wednesday and that Mr. Sanders was forceful in his condemnation of the violence. “He wants to make sure that everyone who asks the question knows the answer: that he 100 percent rejects that type of conduct,” Mr. Merkley said. “We have to step forward and say, totally unacceptable,” he added. “That is the exact opposite of what Trump did. Trump basically embraced violence, encouraged violence. That is a different story. That is the Republican story.” Mr. Merkley said Mr. Sanders remained committed to staying in the race. Turning the pleas of party unity that some Democrats are making around, Mr. Merkley said that the rift in the party would only deepen if Mr. Sanders was driven from the race now. “One of the reasons it is so important for him to stay in this race is that when we go to the convention and we’re building the bridge that brings everyone together, people have to feel like they were heard, that they were respected,” Mr. Merkley said. “You can’t say to them, ‘Hey, we don’t want to hear your views,’ and shut the door on them, and then a month later open the door and say, ‘Hey, can you come in and help us out?’” he added. “He fully intends to go forward.”', 'EXCERPT: I asked Devine: If Clinton wins the nomination after all the votes have been cast, will Sanders issue an unequivocal declaration that the outcome was legitimate? “We’re still involved in this process, so it’s hard for me to declare what’s going to happen at the end,” Devine said. “As we look forward, there are a lot of issues of deep concern.” Devine cited the DNC’s appointment of former Rep. Barney Frank as the chairman of the Democratic National Convention’s Rules Committee and the appointment of Connecticut governor Dan Malloy as the co-chair of the Platform Committee, arguing that both had been “partisan” in their “attacks” on Sanders. “If we’re going to talk about the fairness of the process, we should look at the people who are charged with responsibility of administering the process,” Devine continued. “It’s hard for us to pronounce the process fair when you have committee chairs who have been overt partisans who attacked Senator Sanders in a way that’s way beyond support of Secretary Clinton.” The Sanders campaign had previously criticized these appointments, but in our interview, Devine went further, suggesting that the Sanders camp might have to see them pulled as chairs in order to view the process as legitimate. “To have chairs of committees who have not been overt partisans attacking Senator Sanders [would be] a very positive step in terms of building trust and good will between the campaigns,” Devine said. >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Will Bernie Sanders burn it all down? Washington Post By Greg Sargent May 18 at 1:58 PM A fundamental question about the endgame of the Democratic primaries is this: If and when Hillary Clinton finishes with more pledged delegates and popular votes, and wins the nomination with super-delegate support, will Bernie Sanders do what is necessary to persuade his supporters that the outcome was legitimate? The answer could help determine whether Sanders’s supporters get energized behind Clinton against Donald Trump — and, possibly, whether they will continue to be engaged in politics or become disillusioned with what they have come to believe is a hopelessly rigged and corrupt system. In an interview with me today, top Sanders adviser Tad Devine — while stressing that Sanders would support the eventual nominee — demurred on the broader question of whether he would, in the end, do everything necessary to persuade his supporters of the legitimacy of the process. At the same time, in a separate interview, a top supporter of Sanders — Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon — bluntly told me that if Sanders finishes behind in pledged delegates and the popular vote, he should not continue to try to win over super-delegates, and should concede rather than take the battle to the convention. I asked Devine: If Clinton wins the nomination after all the votes have been cast, will Sanders issue an unequivocal declaration that the outcome was legitimate? “We’re still involved in this process, so it’s hard for me to declare what’s going to happen at the end,” Devine said. “As we look forward, there are a lot of issues of deep concern.” Devine cited the DNC’s appointment of former Rep. Barney Frank as the chairman of the Democratic National Convention’s Rules Committee and the appointment of Connecticut governor Dan Malloy as the co-chair of the Platform Committee, arguing that both had been “partisan” in their “attacks” on Sanders. “If we’re going to talk about the fairness of the process, we should look at the people who are charged with responsibility of administering the process,” Devine continued. “It’s hard for us to pronounce the process fair when you have committee chairs who have been overt partisans who attacked Senator Sanders in a way that’s way beyond support of Secretary Clinton.” The Sanders campaign had previously criticized these appointments, but in our interview, Devine went further, suggesting that the Sanders camp might have to see them pulled as chairs in order to view the process as legitimate. “To have chairs of committees who have not been overt partisans attacking Senator Sanders [would be] a very positive step in terms of building trust and good will between the campaigns,” Devine said. Devine took pains to reiterate that Sanders would support the eventual nominee and do everything possible to defeat Trump, though it’s worth noting that this does not really settle whether Sanders will make a genuine, fully committed effort to persuade his followers that the outcome was the result of a legitimate process. Yesterday, as concern over the skirmishing that took place over the weekend in Nevada mounted, the Sanders campaign issued a statement that doubled down on criticism of the process as rigged. The statement also condemned the violence and death threats leveled at the Nevada state chair, but didn’t lead with that condemnation. I pressed Devine on whether that statement questioning the process in Nevada — and other suggestions from Sanders that aspects of the primaries are rigged — risked going too far, in that it might persuade Sanders supporters that the whole process is illegitimate. I asked whether that risked creating a situation that can’t be repaired. Devine rejected those suggestions. “I don’t think it’s going too far at all,” he said. “Telling the truth is the right thing to do. I think it’s always been a part of what Bernie has done in his career in politics. He’s spoken truth to power….I think it’s helpful….The best way to build the party is to bring people in, not set up rules and procedures that they can’t have confidence in.” All this, however, raises questions about how some of Sanders’s other top supporters will react if this continues. Sanders and his top aides have vowed to continue fighting all the way to the convention to flip super-delegates, and have also suggested they will try to win concessions on rules and the platform. But Senator Merkley — who is from Oregon, where Sanders won yesterday — told me he’s not necessarily on board with a scorched earth approach. I asked him whether Sanders should keep fighting for super-delegates in June, after losing the pledged delegate count and popular vote. “When a nominee wins a majority of both those categories, it is time for us to come together, link arms and go forward,” Merkley said. “It would be inconsistent, given the commentary on super-delegates, to depend on super-delegates to turn over those first two categories of evaluating party members’ support.” Asked if he would support Sanders’s decision, under these conditions, to keep the battle going to the convention floor, Merkley said: “Absolutely not.” It’s hard to say how this will unfold. As aggressive as the Sanders campaign’s rhetoric seems, it would still be consistent with a strategy that includes fighting as hard as possible until the last votes are counted, with the deliberate aim of maximizing whatever leverage Sanders can muster withoutcausing a lasting rift. Such a strategy might include winning as many votes as possible before making a last-ditch effort to flip super-delegates, failing, and entering into unity talks in June that get resolved somehow before the convention, perhaps via platform and process concessions of some kind. Or maybe things will be more contentious than that, all the way to the convention floor and beyond. Right now, the only person with any real inkling of how this will all go down may be Bernie Sanders.', 'KEY EXCERPT: But new audio obtained by CNN shows a senior Sanders aide -- on the eve of the Nevada convention -- encouraging the senator\\'s supporters try to \"take over\" the convention, change party rules and continue the \"revolution\" that Sanders has long campaigned on. \"You should not leave,\" Joan Kato, the national delegates director, told Sanders supporters in a meeting last week at the Rumor Boutique Hotel. \"I\\'m going to repeat that, unless you are told by someone from the campaign ... that you can leave, you should not leave.\" The Sanders campaign hasn\\'t responded to a request for comment. Dems\\' new fear: Sanders revolt could upend Democratic convention By Manu Raju, Senior Political Reporter Sen. Barbara Boxer, a veteran of Democratic politics, says she never saw anything quite like this before. Loud cursing, shouting, obscene gestures and vile insults, including crude comments about the female anatomy. It was all on display over the weekend as supporters of Bernie Sanders turned the Nevada State Democratic Convention into chaos. \"I was not able to stop these people for doing what they did,\" Boxer, a Hillary Clinton supporter, told CNN. \"Apparently they\\'ve done it before. .... This group of about 100 were very vocal, and I can\\'t describe it -- disrespectful doesn\\'t even explain it, it was worse than that.\" Boxer is hardly the lone Clinton supporter to experience such harassment on the campaign trail. Several top Democrats told CNN publicly and privately that the energy and enthusiasm of Sanders supporters has at times descended into incendiary attacks that threaten to tear apart efforts to unite Democrats against Donald Trump. Several female senators told CNN the attacks have been misogynistic. What\\'s more, many Democrats fear that if Sanders does not rein in his supporters, the same ugly scene that occurred in Las Vegas last weekend could replicate itself in the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. \"He should get things under control,\" Boxer said of Sanders, saying it was worse than the vitriol during the Bush-Gore 2000 recount. \"We\\'re in a race that is very critical. We have to be united. He knows that. I have in fact, called him a couple times, left a couple messages. I\\'m hopeful he can get control of this.\" Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California said \"I do\" when asked if Sanders should drop out of the race after voting concludes on June 7, giving Clinton a chance to \"pivot\" to the general election ahead of the July convention. \"I think it would be most regretful if there becomes a schism,\" Feinstein said. \"That\\'s what Donald Trump should want: a schism in our party. ... It\\'s the responsibility particularly of Sen. Sanders to see that that doesn\\'t happen.\" Nevada chaos Sanders officials say that the Democratic Party should embrace the senator\\'s supporters, not repel them. While they say they don\\'t condone the behavior of some of their supporters at the Nevada convention, they blame leaders of the Nevada Democratic Party for shutting out Sanders\\' backers, prompting the chaos. But new audio obtained by CNN shows a senior Sanders aide -- on the eve of the Nevada convention -- encouraging the senator\\'s supporters try to \"take over\" the convention, change party rules and continue the \"revolution\" that Sanders has long campaigned on. \"You should not leave,\" Joan Kato, the national delegates director, told Sanders supporters in a meeting last week at the Rumor Boutique Hotel. \"I\\'m going to repeat that, unless you are told by someone from the campaign ... that you can leave, you should not leave.\" The Sanders campaign hasn\\'t responded to a request for comment. After Sanders supporters thought the convention was being shut down prematurely, loud shouting ensued and there were reports of chairs being hurled. The phone number and address of the chairwoman of the Nevada Democratic Party, Roberta Lange, was posted on social media -- prompting a flood of more than 1,000 calls, angry voicemails, text messages and even death threats. \"This is a citizen of the United States of America and I just wanted to let you know that I think people like you should be hung in a public execution to show this world that we won\\'t stand for this sort of corruption,\" an unidentified male caller said on the message, provided to CNN and other news outlets. \"I don\\'t know what kind of money they are paying to you, but I don\\'t know how you sleep at night. You are a sick, twisted piece of s--- and I hope you burn for this! .... You cowardless b---, running off the stage! I hope people find you.\" One text message read: \"We know where you live... where your kids go to school/grandkids. We have everything on you.\" On Tuesday, the Nevada Democratic Party sent a formal complaint to the Democratic National Committee, saying Sanders backers and campaign officials \"actively incited disruption and violence\" at the convention. Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver said on CNN\\'s \"New Day\" Tuesday that \"people who are supporting the senator should act in a civil way.\" \"They should obviously fight within the context, and by fight, I mean contest if there is a convention, they should be there, they should present their case, and then they should let the votes fall where they may,\" Weaver said, adding there should be no \"threats of violence.\" But he also took aim at Democratic leaders in Nevada, saying the \"state party has a lot of problems,\" is run \"poorly\" and the system in the Silver State is done \"very undemocratically\" and is \"dysfunctional.\" \"There seems to be an unwillingness on the party of the Nevada Democratic Party to bring in all of the new people that Bernie Sanders has brought into the process,\" Weaver said. On Monday evening, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid -- who has ruled the Nevada state party for years -- blamed Sanders backers for inciting the bedlam that ensued at the convention. \"I\\'ve been dealing with Nevada state conventions for 50 years: To say I was disappointed was an understatement,\" Reid told CNN Monday. \"I hold his people accountable, and I\\'m sure if Bernie found out about it, he would not accept what happened there.\" Fears of Philadelphia unrest With Sanders warning that he plans to take his campaign to the July convention in Philadelphia, even if he\\'s trailing Clinton in pledged delegates, Democrats are growing increasingly fearful that what happened in Nevada could be repeated just as the party is struggling to unite after a spirited primary. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois said \"of course\" he\\'s concerned that the same tactics would be replicated in Philadelphia. \"We saw what happened at the Trump rallies, which broke into violence, people punching one another. I don\\'t want to see that happen at the Democratic Party,\" Durbin said in an interview in the Capitol. \"I call on Bernie to say to his supporters: be fervent, be committed but be sensible. Don\\'t engage in any violence.\" Top Democrats say that it is incumbent on Sanders to bring his supporters in the fold -- or risk electing Trump. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat who backs Clinton, said she has never before dealt with more aggressive supporters than Sanders\\' voters. \"It\\'s been interesting to me because I\\'ve never experienced that before and I\\'ve been involved in every presidential campaign since 1976,\" Shaheen said. \"We\\'ve had lots of people who have supported different candidates, and I\\'ve never seen that kind of behavior before.\" Shaheen recalled an event days before the New Hampshire primary in February when Sanders supporters were \"very aggressive,\" \"heckling me and others as we spoke.\" \"That has never happened before,\" Shaheen said. The senator added: \"In this campaign, (Sanders) has gotten a lot of people engaged, he should be able to go through the primaries as he\\'s committed to do -- Hillary Clinton did that in 2008,\" Shaheen said. \"Hopefully, once the nomination is done, then he will endorse the nominee.\"', 'Sanders issues defiant statement under pressure over ruckus ERICA WERNER AP Congressional Correspondent WASHINGTON (AP) - Under pressure from Democratic Party leaders to denounce ugly violence by his supporters, Sen. Bernie Sanders instead struck back with a defiant statement Tuesday that dismissed complaints from Nevada Democrats as \"nonsense\" and asserted that his backers were not being treated with \"fairness and respect.\" It followed chaos at the Nevada Democratic Party Saturday night, where Sanders\\' supporters threw chairs, shouted down speakers and harassed the state party chair with death threats. Gravely alarmed, Democrats pressed Sanders to forcefully denounce it. But the dispute stands as the most public rift yet between the Sanders camp and other Democrats, and may undermine the party\\'s attempt to maintain a unified front as frustration mounts among Hillary Clinton supporters that Sanders is continuing his campaign with no clear path to victory. \"Our campaign of course believes in non-violent change and it goes without saying that I condemn any and all forms of violence, including the personal harassment of individuals,\" Sanders said. But far from apologizing for anything his supporters did, Sanders repeated, in detail, their complaints that they were railroaded in the delegate process Saturday night, something Democratic officials deny. \"The Democratic leadership used its power to prevent a fair and transparent process from taking place,\" he said. Sanders issued his statement moments after speaking with Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, who told reporters that Sanders had condemned the violence in Las Vegas. \"This is a test of leadership as we all know, and I\\'m hopeful and very confident Sen. Sanders will do the right thing,\" Reid said. The head of the Democratic Party, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., also condemned he events in Las Vegas. \"There is no excuse for what happened in Nevada, and it is incumbent upon all of us in positions of leadership to speak out,\" she said. Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who was booed when she spoke at the convention, told reporters Tuesday that she\\'d feared for her safety and said Sanders should give a \"major speech\" calling on his supporters to reject violence and opt for unity. Sanders\\' statement seems unlikely to satisfy the demands from Reid, Wasserman Schultz, Boxer and others. It comes as Donald Trump is wrapping up the nomination on the Republican side, yet Democrats remain divided and now some Democrats fear that Sanders\\' supporters are starting to mimic backers of Trump in their sexist and aggressive behavior. Democrats also fear that the unrest in Nevada could be a taste of what is to come at the Democratic Party convention in Philadelphia this summer. Stephanie Schriock, president of EMILY\\'s List, an influential political committee devoted to electing women that has come out in support of Clinton, said in a statement: \"These disgraceful attacks are straight out of the Donald Trump playbook, and Bernie Sanders is the only person who can put a stop to them. Sanders needs to both forcefully denounce and apologize for his supporters\\' unacceptable behavior - not walk away.\" Leading Democrats still stopped short of calling on Sanders to abandon his quixotic campaign, at least in public, training their concerns on the violence at the Nevada convention. \"I am concerned if our party becomes labeled with the notion that we have this kind of violence,\" said Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Senate Democrat. Chair throwing, shouted profanities and even later death threats to party leaders marked Saturday\\'s party meeting. The Nevada Democratic Party send a letter to the Democratic National Committee accusing supporters of presidential candidate Bernie Sanders of having a \"penchant for extra-parliamentary behavior - indeed, actual violence - in place of democratic conduct in a convention setting.\" Sanders dismissed that as \"nonsense.\" \\'\\'Our campaign has held giant rallies all across this country, including in high crime areas, and there have been zero reports of violence,\" he said. \"It is imperative that the Democratic leadership, both nationally and in the states, understand that the political world is changing and that millions of Americans are outraged at establishment politics and establishment economics,\" he said. Democratic officials released text messages and voicemails with threats against the Nevada Democratic Party chairwoman Roberta Lange. They included such comments as \" Hey bitch, loved how you broke the system, we know where you live, where you work, where you eat, where your kids go to school ...

Speaking at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., the Vermont senator argued that Clinton \"will need superdelegates to take her over the top at the convention in Philadelphia. In other words, it will be a contested convention.\" Sanders said that in the states where he handily defeated Clinton, superdelegates who aren\\'t supporting him should reconsider aligning themselves with the will of voters of those states. \"In the state of Washington, we won that caucus with almost 73 percent of the vote there — 73 percent of the vote. In anybody\\'s opinion, that is a massive landslide. But at this point Secretary Clinton has 10 superdelegates from the state of Washington, we have zero,\" Sanders said, offering an example of a state where he won the popular vote but did not collect any superdelegates. \"I would ask the superdelegates from the state of Washington to respect the wishes from the people in their state and the votes they have cast.\" Sanders\\' comments came just ahead of Tuesday’s Indiana primary, as his path to the nomination has become even more narrow due to recent defeats. The campaign recently laid off a large number of staff members in states that have voted. Clinton currently has 1,645 delegates and 520 superdelegates, while Sanders has 1,318 delegates and 39 superdelegates. In total, 2,383 delegates are needed to win the Democratic nomination. Sanders conceded that it wouldn\\'t be easy for him to close the margin, but he said he would continue fighting. \"For us to win the majority of pledged delegates, we need to win 710 out of the remaining 1083,\" Sanders said. \"That is 65 percent. That is, admittedly, a tough road to climb, but not an impossible one. And we intend to fight for every vote and delegate remaining.\"', '', '', 'A good story for us. Also, no DWS criticisms included. Obama, who once stood as party outsider, now works to strengthen Democrats By Juliet Eilperin April 25 at 6:39 PM Barack Obama rose to prominence as a different kind of Democrat, an outsider who was not part of the establishment and who would chart a separate course. Eight years later, the president finds himself working hard to restore a party from which he was once eager to stand apart. Obama has presided over a greater loss of electoral power for his party than any two-term president since World War II. And 2016 represents one last opportunity for him to reverse that trend. But it is also a challenge for the president who has experimented with establishing his own political base outside the Democratic National Committee and has downsized the scale of political operations inside the White House. The first big tests of the rebuilding efforts comes Tuesday in Pennsylvania, where Obama is taking the unusual step of wading into two contested Democratic primaries, endorsing Senate hopeful Katie McGinty and Josh Shapiro, a Montgomery County official and early supporter of his who is hoping to become state attorney general. Should Democrats claim those two offices in the fall, it would represent a small dent in what has become a worrisome decline of power for the party below the presidential level under Obama’s watch. Between 2008 and 2015, Democrats lost 13 Senate seats, 69 House seats, 913 state legislative seats, 11 governorships and 32 state legislative chambers, according to data compiled by University of Virginia professor Larry J. Sabato. The only president in the past 75 years who comes close is Dwight D. Eisenhower, who saw a similar decline for the GOP during his time in office. “The Republican Party is arguably stronger now than they’ve ever been in 80 years, despite not having the White House,” said Simon Rosenberg, a longtime Democratic operative and president of NDN, a liberal think tank. Democrats also are concerned about whether the coalition Obama galvanized in 2008, and then reassembled in 2012, will turn out when he is no longer on the ballot. The current Democratic presidential primary contest has so far fractured that coalition, with young people flocking to Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont while many voters of color — especially older ones — back former secretary of state Hillary Clinton. Many factors have contributed to Republicans’ gains on the state and federal level, including a concerted push by their donors to target state races and a midterm election that allowed them to lock in favorable congressional district lines. Obama’s defenders contend that after major victories in 2006 and 2008, it was predictable that Democrats would lose significant ground in the midterm elections of 2010 and 2014. But, they add, the president’s two successful White House bids have vastly upgraded the party’s voter outreach infrastructure by expanding the national voter file the Democratic National Committee first started in 2006. And they point to the huge increases in the number of Democratic campaign volunteers — from roughly 252,000 in 2004 to 2.2 million in 2012 — as evidence of that upgrade. “Barack Obama has single-handedly modernized the Democrats’ ability to wage campaigns on the local level,” said Jim Messina, who managed Obama’s re\\xadelection campaign. Rosenberg agrees, saying that the president built on the work of Bill Clinton, the only other two-term Democratic president of the last generation. “Clinton established the intellectual framework for the Democratic Party and Obama modernized its politics,” Rosenberg said. “What isn’t there yet is a large enough set of leaders from the next generation to carry it on.” Some of Obama’s earliest decisions continue to reverberate negatively for Democrats. Organizing for Action (OFA), the nonprofit group that grew out of Obama’s campaign operation, has continued to compete with the Democratic National Committee for Democratic dollars — first as a parallel organization within the DNC and then as a separate entity. In the first six months of 2013, the DNC raised $30.8 million, while OFA raised $13 million. And this was at a time when the DNC was carrying more than $18 million in debt. Those fiscal constraints meant the DNC had to curtail the money it provided to state parties, a practice that DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) reversed in 2015 by increasing the monthly minimum transfer to each state from $5,000 a month to $7,500. Close cooperation has taken time; OFA gave the DNC limited access to its list of supporters starting in 2013, but it turned over the entire list only in August 2015. Now, according to Nevada Democratic Party chair Roberta Lange, “That voter file is used by everyone in our state.” While many OFA volunteers have focused on local referendums and other local political battles, the group has earned the enmity of some party stalwarts for diverting resources. During a 2010 gathering of Democratic governors in Washington, according to multiple attendees, one governor asked a senior presidential political adviser, “Will the OFA please join the Democratic Party?” But this White House, unlike that of Bill Clinton, has always kept its political operation on a separate track. Under Clinton, the political affairs office boasted roughly a dozen people — in addition to the deputy chief of staff who oversaw political affairs — and the president got a political briefing once a week. By contrast, Obama limited election activity in the White House, a reflection of both his desire to keep any scandal at bay and the influence of White House chief of staff Denis McDonough, who has little campaign experience outside of working on Obama’s first presidential bid. Obama phased out the political affairs office after two years to move the operation to his Chicago campaign headquarters. He appointed David Simas, who directs the White House Office of Political Strategy and Outreach, to his current position only in January 2014, after congressional Democrats complained they did not have a direct White House contact for political matters. Obama’s senior political advisers from his first term — Messina, David Plouffe and David Axelrod, among others — have left to focus on ventures in the private sector and academia and scaled back their involvement in day-to-day Democratic politics. Plouffe said it was natural for veteran strategists to move on, but acknowledged that Obama’s relationship with his top political operatives didn’t automatically translate to other candidates. “You don’t do your best work being a mercenary,” said Plouffe, now a strategic adviser to the car service firm Uber. He added that it will take the commitment of wealthy Democratic donors — not just top party officials — to target state contests the way Republicans have. “I think we all agree something has to be done,” he said. “The question is how. It’s not going to be the DNC.” Obama, for his part, has set limits for what he will do in connection with super PACs while in office. While he did fundraising events for the one that backed his reelection campaign, Priorities USA, McDonough and Obama’s lawyers curtailed what the president would do two years later for the Senate Majority PAC, a similar entity supporting Senate Democrats. In an April 2014 memo to then-Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.), the PAC’s counsel, Marc E. Elias, stipulated that to avoid any conflict of interest Obama would not actually ask potential Senate Majority PAC donors for money even when appearing at one of the group’s events. After making this point on the memo’s first page, he reiterated two pages later, with underlined emphasis: “Again, to be clear: the President will not solicit contributions at or in connection with any of these meetings.” After a protracted and bitter exchange, Reid’s aides abandoned their effort to involve Obama in any more than a few super PAC events, and the president agreed to transfer $5 million from the DNC to both the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in the fall of 2014. During the 2012 cycle, the DNC made no transfers to the two committees. But with his popularity high among Democrats and no election ahead of him, Obama has been working to shore up his party, both financially and politically. And his aides say Obama has turned controversial issues, including immigration, gay rights and climate change, to the Democrats’ advantage. “He will be aggressive, from the presidential level down to the state and local representative level,” Simas said. “There’s going to be a Democratic nominee and Democratic candidates. They are the ones who are going to be driving the campaigns, and the president will be there to be as helpful as possible.” Recently in Dallas, before dozens of guests who had each given thousands of dollars to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Obama diagnosed one of the problems: “Democrats just aren’t very good at focusing on down-ballot races,” he said, according to two participants. The president may have been stating the obvious. But it reflected a shift in thinking among Democrats, who are working furiously to shore up state-level candidates to avoid getting beaten once again on redistricting. Since 2013, Obama has devoted considerable time to fundraising for the DNC and both congressional committees, doing more than 100 events for the DNC alone. Sen. Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.), the second-ranking Democrat in the Senate, said that when he asked Obama to make a series of primary endorsements this cycle, including one of McGinty, “He just did it with no muss, no fuss, in a very great way.” In December, the heads of three party committees met to develop a joint redistricting strategy, and Obama signed a redistricting fundraising appeal for the Democratic Governors Association in January. Even former members such as Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) have been asked to attend fundraisers on behalf of state lawmakers in states such as Ohio. “We have to be better and smarter about playing that long game and making those investments,” said Rep. Steve Israel (D-N.Y.), adding that while House Democrats will have “a very strong wind at their backs” this year, “The day after this election, we have to understand that the wind’s going to be in our faces.” In 2014, many Democrats in conservative states were eager to tap Obama’s fundraising prowess but were reluctant to appear side-by-side with a president with sagging popularity ratings. Already, 2016 is different. Longtime Democratic strategist Donna Brazile said that for a long time Democrats wanted Obama’s resources — including money and analytics — “but they didn’t want his presence.” When she called the White House last year to ask if the president would do robocalls to African American voters during Louisiana’s special election for governor, White House officials seemed surprised that Democrat John Bel Edwards even wanted their help. Brazile assured them that he did. And Democrats increasingly believe that they will need Obama in the fall to regain some of the ground they’ve lost since 2008. “Part of his legacy is to rebuild the bench,” Brazile said. Democratic Congressional Committee Chairman Ben Ray Luján (N.M.) said in an interview that the president will help in unifying the Democratic base. “He’s going to help boost turnout in November, which is critical when you’re winning races on the margins,” Luján said.', 'Just in: @TedCruz is ending his presidential campaign, campaign manager Jeff Roe tells me.

The decision is the first time Google has announced a global ban on ads for a broad category of financial products. To this point, the search giant has prohibited ads for largely illicit activities such as selling guns, explosives and drugs, and limited those that are sexually explicit or graphic in nature, for example. Critics of payday lenders say they hope the move by Google and other tech companies might undercut the business which finds huge numbers of willing customers on the internet. The move also shows the willingness of big tech companies to weigh in on critical policy issues -- and exert their power as the gateways for the internet. Facebook also does not display ads for payday loans. But others, such as Yahoo, still do. Consumers will still be able to find payday lenders from a Google search. But the ads that appear on the top and right-hand side of a search results page will not show marketing from the payday lending industry beginning on July 13. \"We’ll continue to review the effectiveness of this policy, but our hope is that fewer people will be exposed to misleading or harmful products,\" Google global product policy director David Graff said in a blog post about the change. Washington regulators, as well as a handful of states, have been trying to limit the activities of payday lenders by capping how much they can charge consumers in an interest rate. But the decisions by tech giants Facebook and Google – the two biggest websites on the planet – might have as much impact as any single regulation in restricting access to payday lenders. Industry officials, speaking generally of advertising restrictions placed on payday lenders, called the policies “discriminatory,” adding that some consumers may need access to the short-term loans if they can’t get credit them through a traditional bank. “Facebook and others are making a blanket assessment about the payday lending industry rather than discerning the good actors from the bad actors,” the Community Financial Services Association of America, a payday lending trade group, said in a statement. “This is unfair towards those that are legal, licensed lenders.” Millions of low-income Americans use the short-term loans to get cash quickly while planning to repay their balance once they get their next paycheck. But all too often, borrowers get caught in a vicious cycle where fees quickly mount and annual interest rates can be in the triple-digits. In many cases, this debt drama plays out online -- and starts with a search query. \"You search the internet when you need help -- and as a result you may give search engines some really sensitive information about your finances,\" explained Alvaro Bedoya, the executive director of Georgetown Law\\'s Center on Privacy & Technology. When those desperate searches return targeted ads for payday loans, lenders end up profiting from the weaknesses those people have shared, he said. But once a borrower has committed to an online payday loan, they may end up facing unexpected financial risks. According to a recent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau analysis, half of borrowers who took out online payday loans were later hit with an average of $185 worth of bank fees or penalties when a lender submitted automatic repayment requests they couldn\\'t afford. The CFPB is working on a proposed rule targeting the industry which it expects to unveil later this spring. The agency is considering rules that would limit the number of times consumers could rollover a loan, capping them at two or three loans total. The rules might also require lenders to verify consumers’ income and borrowing history to gauge their ability to pay back the loan. Google itself had previously taken some steps to limit payday loan ads. The decision to ban them outright came in part after pressure from a coalition of civil liberties, consumer protection, and privacy groups that reached out to the search giant about the issue late last year. The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights was one of those groups. “This new policy addresses many of the longstanding concerns shared by the entire civil rights community about predatory payday lending,\" Wade Henderson, the group\\'s president and chief executive, said in a statement. \"Low-income people and people of color have long been targeted by slick advertising and aggressive marketing campaigns to trap consumers into outrageously high interest loans.” To enforce the policy, those seeking to market financial products through Google\\'s sprawling advertising network will be required to disclose the length of the loan and the annual interest rate before they will be allowed to place ads. In addition to the broad payday loan ad ban, Google will not display ads from lenders who charge annual interest rates of 36 percent or more in the United States. The same standards will apply to sites that serve as middlemen who connect distressed borrowers to those lenders. That\\'s important because banning ads for payday loans themselves may not be enough, according to some advocates. \"If you type in a search term that indicates financial distress, most of the ads you\\'ll see will be for websites that are not the payday lenders themselves, but marketing companies who collect leads then auction them off to the lenders,\" said Aaron Rieke, one of the authors of a reporton online payday lending advertisements released by consulting firm Upturn last year. Google, of course, has also profited from those ads. Although they likely make up only a small fraction of the company\\'s staggering online advertising revenues -- which were more than $18 billion in the first quarter of this year -- banning them will mean the company is leaving dollars on the table. To advocates like Bedoya, that\\'s a good thing. \"Google is taking a principled stance here,\" he said. \"Hopefully, it\\'s one that will help set a new standard for search engines.\" Mark Paustenbach National Press Secretary & Deputy Communications Director Democratic National Committee W: 202.863.8148 paustenbachm@dnc.org', 'Clinton: \\'No way\\' I won\\'t be Democratic nominee POLITICO By NICK GASS 05/19/16 02:17 PM EDT Hillary Clinton on Thursday said there is \"no way\" that she will not be the Democratic presidential nominee in 2016, and that Bernie Sanders would do well to unify behind her as the party\\'s standard-bearer against Donald Trump \"I will be the nominee for my party, Chris,\" the former secretary of state told CNN\\'s Chris Cuomo in an interview from Park Ridge, Illinois. \"That is already done, in effect.

For a campaign expected to cost more than $1 billion, “I’ll be putting up money, but won’t be completely self-funding, as I did during the primaries,” Mr. Trump said on Wednesday. The New York businessman, who did receive some mostly, small unsolicited donations, lent his campaign $36 million of the $47 million he spent through March. That plan represents a shift for Mr. Trump, who has for months portrayed his Republican opponents as “puppets” for relying on super PACs and taking contributions from wealthy donors that he said came with strings attached. Mr. Trump is planning to use his expansive personal Rolodex to ensure his campaign has the resources to compete against Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton in November, while the campaign will tap into a new base of Trump supporters who aren’t on party rolls, two Trump advisers said. The presumptive Republican nominee, known for operating on a tight budget in a primary where he enjoyed more than $2 billion in free media attention, is also likely to implement a business plan that may be less costly than traditional political campaigns, a senior aide said. The campaign is also beginning to work with the Republican National Committee to set up a joint fundraising vehicle, after his last two rivals—Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov.John Kasich—dropped out in the wake of Mr. Trump’s resounding Indiana win on Tuesday. He plans to actively help the Republican Party and other GOP candidates with fundraising through events, direct-mail and online appeals, an aide said. Beginning to actively solicit donations, while a super PAC backing him also ramps up his activity, means the billionaire will no longer have that club to use against his Democratic opponent in the general election. The move is also likely to put off some Trump supporters, many of whom have said his self-funding makes them trust him more than other politicians.

Three have been held, but the final debate, to be held in California in May according to the agreement, doesn\\'t seem to be going anywhere fast. There are 19 days left in May, and the California primary is on June 7. At the moment there have been few if any discussions about a date, location, or network agreed upon between the campaigns and the Democratic National Committee, multiple sources said. The Sanders campaign has not been in negotiations with the Clinton campaign or the DNC, and is waiting for a cable network to come forward to offer a location and a primetime slot, a Sanders adviser said on background. Spokesman Michael Briggs said they\\'re trying to \\'nail down a date and location\\' but would only say that there \\'have been discussions\\' when asked for specifics. The last Democratic debate, hosted by CNN in Brooklyn, came together just ten days before through a rather public negotiation, which the Sanders adviser said they expect to happen again. All three cable networks have expressed interest, the adviser said, but none have specifically come forward with a time or place. (Cable networks this season have been spending tidy sums to reserve locations on different dates and in different cities that could be used for possible debates or town halls). The Sanders campaign has often gone around the DNC in debate negotiations, and even sought to exclude the DNC from the Brooklyn debate last month. \"As voters in the remaining states and territories make up their minds about the future of the Democratic Party, I believe they deserve a chance to compare my record and Secretary Clinton\\'s record on creating jobs, raising the minimum wage, war and peace, the need for health care for all, breaking up big banks, combating climate change and other critical issues. Secretary Clinton\\'s campaign already has agreed to another debate in California. I hope that we can soon settle on a date and place for that debate,\" Sanders said on Tuesday night after winning the West Virginia primary. Asked about the negotiations for an upcoming debate or whether one is still in the works, DNC spokesman Luis Miranda said there was \\'no update at this time.\" A Clinton campaign spokesman declined to comment.

Here is a statement for your review. Thanks, Mark For Immediate Release May 4, 2016 Contact – DNC Press 202-863-8148 DNC Chair Wasserman Schultz’s Statement on Governor Kasich’s Announcement that he is Suspending his Campaign for President “With Governor Kasich out of the race, any remaining hope the GOP had of concealing its true colors behind his comparatively friendly-faced candidacy has evaporated. But make no mistake, the extreme policies he has long fought for are virtually indistinguishable from those of Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, and the rest of the modern Republican Party. “Under Kasich, Ohio’s job growth has trailed the national average for 40 straight months. He promised to fight any federal increase in the minimum wage. And he has one of the most extreme anti-choice records of any governor in the country, having signed legislation that shut down half the abortion clinics in his state. “For years, Republican leaders have employed a divisive political strategy to compel people to vote out of distrust, suspicion and hate – rewarding those at the top and denigrating women, minorities, the LGBT community and more in the process. The result is the cynical, divided, bickering Republican base we see now. Today, the only energy left in the Republican primary isn’t for anything, and their final contest is already shaping up to be a bitter, petty battle with one camp against Trump, and the other against Cruz. “The contrast couldn’t be more stark. Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are fighting for the American people – for higher wages, for more opportunity, for a level playing field and for a brighter future. Our voters are energized, enthusiastic, and optimistic because our candidates are committed to moving America forward. And that’s why we’re going to win on Election Day in November.” ###', 'Sanders Campaign Statement on Clinton’s Comments May 19, 2016 Contact: Michael Briggs (802) 233-8653 PALM SPRINGS, Calif. – U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders’ spokesman, Michael Briggs, on Thursday issued the following statement after Secretary Hillary Clinton told CNN she will be the Democratic Party’s nominee for president: “In the past three weeks voters in Indiana, West Virginia and Oregon respectfully disagreed with Secretary Clinton. We expect voters in the remaining eight contests also will disagree. And with almost every national and state poll showing Sen. Sanders doing much, much better than Secretary Clinton against Donald Trump, it is clear that millions of Americans have growing doubts about the Clinton campaign.” ###', 'Sanders issues defiant statement under pressure over ruckus ERICA WERNER AP Congressional Correspondent WASHINGTON (AP) - Under pressure from Democratic Party leaders to denounce ugly violence by his supporters, Sen. Bernie Sanders instead struck back with a defiant statement Tuesday that dismissed complaints from Nevada Democrats as \"nonsense\" and asserted that his backers were not being treated with \"fairness and respect.\" It followed chaos at the Nevada Democratic Party Saturday night, where Sanders\\' supporters threw chairs, shouted down speakers and harassed the state party chair with death threats. Gravely alarmed, Democrats pressed Sanders to forcefully denounce it. But the dispute stands as the most public rift yet between the Sanders camp and other Democrats, and may undermine the party\\'s attempt to maintain a unified front as frustration mounts among Hillary Clinton supporters that Sanders is continuing his campaign with no clear path to victory. \"Our campaign of course believes in non-violent change and it goes without saying that I condemn any and all forms of violence, including the personal harassment of individuals,\" Sanders said. But far from apologizing for anything his supporters did, Sanders repeated, in detail, their complaints that they were railroaded in the delegate process Saturday night, something Democratic officials deny. \"The Democratic leadership used its power to prevent a fair and transparent process from taking place,\" he said. Sanders issued his statement moments after speaking with Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, who told reporters that Sanders had condemned the violence in Las Vegas. \"This is a test of leadership as we all know, and I\\'m hopeful and very confident Sen. Sanders will do the right thing,\" Reid said. The head of the Democratic Party, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., also condemned he events in Las Vegas. \"There is no excuse for what happened in Nevada, and it is incumbent upon all of us in positions of leadership to speak out,\" she said. Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who was booed when she spoke at the convention, told reporters Tuesday that she\\'d feared for her safety and said Sanders should give a \"major speech\" calling on his supporters to reject violence and opt for unity. Sanders\\' statement seems unlikely to satisfy the demands from Reid, Wasserman Schultz, Boxer and others. It comes as Donald Trump is wrapping up the nomination on the Republican side, yet Democrats remain divided and now some Democrats fear that Sanders\\' supporters are starting to mimic backers of Trump in their sexist and aggressive behavior. Democrats also fear that the unrest in Nevada could be a taste of what is to come at the Democratic Party convention in Philadelphia this summer. Stephanie Schriock, president of EMILY\\'s List, an influential political committee devoted to electing women that has come out in support of Clinton, said in a statement: \"These disgraceful attacks are straight out of the Donald Trump playbook, and Bernie Sanders is the only person who can put a stop to them. Sanders needs to both forcefully denounce and apologize for his supporters\\' unacceptable behavior - not walk away.\" Leading Democrats still stopped short of calling on Sanders to abandon his quixotic campaign, at least in public, training their concerns on the violence at the Nevada convention. \"I am concerned if our party becomes labeled with the notion that we have this kind of violence,\" said Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Senate Democrat. Chair throwing, shouted profanities and even later death threats to party leaders marked Saturday\\'s party meeting. The Nevada Democratic Party send a letter to the Democratic National Committee accusing supporters of presidential candidate Bernie Sanders of having a \"penchant for extra-parliamentary behavior - indeed, actual violence - in place of democratic conduct in a convention setting.\" Sanders dismissed that as \"nonsense.\" \\'\\'Our campaign has held giant rallies all across this country, including in high crime areas, and there have been zero reports of violence,\" he said. \"It is imperative that the Democratic leadership, both nationally and in the states, understand that the political world is changing and that millions of Americans are outraged at establishment politics and establishment economics,\" he said. Democratic officials released text messages and voicemails with threats against the Nevada Democratic Party chairwoman Roberta Lange. They included such comments as \" Hey bitch, loved how you broke the system, we know where you live, where you work, where you eat, where your kids go to school ... You made a bad choice, prepare for hell, calls won\\'t stop.\"', 'Ryan sets schedule for Thursday Trump meetings By Rachel Bade 05/10/16 - 03:40 PM EDT Donald Trump will meet face-to-face with Speaker Paul Ryan at 9 a.m. on Thursday at the RNC, according to a GOP leadership source familiar with the schedule. RNC Chairman Reince Priebus will sit in the meeting, too. A second meeting including Ryan, Trump and a larger roster of GOP leadership will follow. Attendees will include Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.), Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.), and Deputy Whip Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) There will be no press availability after, but Ryan will do an on-camera availability later that morning, the source said. Trump has no plans to meet with Trump endorsers at this time, according to two additional sources familiar with this schedule.

Dems\\' new fear: Sanders revolt could upend Democratic convention By Manu Raju, Senior Political Reporter Sen. Barbara Boxer, a veteran of Democratic politics, says she never saw anything quite like this before. Loud cursing, shouting, obscene gestures and vile insults, including crude comments about the female anatomy. It was all on display over the weekend as supporters of Bernie Sanders turned the Nevada State Democratic Convention into chaos. \"I was not able to stop these people for doing what they did,\" Boxer, a Hillary Clinton supporter, told CNN. \"Apparently they\\'ve done it before. .... This group of about 100 were very vocal, and I can\\'t describe it -- disrespectful doesn\\'t even explain it, it was worse than that.\" Boxer is hardly the lone Clinton supporter to experience such harassment on the campaign trail. Several top Democrats told CNN publicly and privately that the energy and enthusiasm of Sanders supporters has at times descended into incendiary attacks that threaten to tear apart efforts to unite Democrats against Donald Trump. Several female senators told CNN the attacks have been misogynistic. What\\'s more, many Democrats fear that if Sanders does not rein in his supporters, the same ugly scene that occurred in Las Vegas last weekend could replicate itself in the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. \"He should get things under control,\" Boxer said of Sanders, saying it was worse than the vitriol during the Bush-Gore 2000 recount. \"We\\'re in a race that is very critical. We have to be united. He knows that. I have in fact, called him a couple times, left a couple messages. I\\'m hopeful he can get control of this.\" Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California said \"I do\" when asked if Sanders should drop out of the race after voting concludes on June 7, giving Clinton a chance to \"pivot\" to the general election ahead of the July convention. \"I think it would be most regretful if there becomes a schism,\" Feinstein said. \"That\\'s what Donald Trump should want: a schism in our party. ... It\\'s the responsibility particularly of Sen. Sanders to see that that doesn\\'t happen.\" Nevada chaos Sanders officials say that the Democratic Party should embrace the senator\\'s supporters, not repel them. While they say they don\\'t condone the behavior of some of their supporters at the Nevada convention, they blame leaders of the Nevada Democratic Party for shutting out Sanders\\' backers, prompting the chaos. But new audio obtained by CNN shows a senior Sanders aide -- on the eve of the Nevada convention -- encouraging the senator\\'s supporters try to \"take over\" the convention, change party rules and continue the \"revolution\" that Sanders has long campaigned on. \"You should not leave,\" Joan Kato, the national delegates director, told Sanders supporters in a meeting last week at the Rumor Boutique Hotel. \"I\\'m going to repeat that, unless you are told by someone from the campaign ... that you can leave, you should not leave.\" The Sanders campaign hasn\\'t responded to a request for comment. After Sanders supporters thought the convention was being shut down prematurely, loud shouting ensued and there were reports of chairs being hurled. The phone number and address of the chairwoman of the Nevada Democratic Party, Roberta Lange, was posted on social media -- prompting a flood of more than 1,000 calls, angry voicemails, text messages and even death threats. \"This is a citizen of the United States of America and I just wanted to let you know that I think people like you should be hung in a public execution to show this world that we won\\'t stand for this sort of corruption,\" an unidentified male caller said on the message, provided to CNN and other news outlets. \"I don\\'t know what kind of money they are paying to you, but I don\\'t know how you sleep at night. You are a sick, twisted piece of s--- and I hope you burn for this! .... You cowardless b---, running off the stage! I hope people find you.\" One text message read: \"We know where you live... where your kids go to school/grandkids. We have everything on you.\" On Tuesday, the Nevada Democratic Party sent a formal complaint to the Democratic National Committee, saying Sanders backers and campaign officials \"actively incited disruption and violence\" at the convention. Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver said on CNN\\'s \"New Day\" Tuesday that \"people who are supporting the senator should act in a civil way.\" \"They should obviously fight within the context, and by fight, I mean contest if there is a convention, they should be there, they should present their case, and then they should let the votes fall where they may,\" Weaver said, adding there should be no \"threats of violence.\" But he also took aim at Democratic leaders in Nevada, saying the \"state party has a lot of problems,\" is run \"poorly\" and the system in the Silver State is done \"very undemocratically\" and is \"dysfunctional.\" \"There seems to be an unwillingness on the party of the Nevada Democratic Party to bring in all of the new people that Bernie Sanders has brought into the process,\" Weaver said. On Monday evening, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid -- who has ruled the Nevada state party for years -- blamed Sanders backers for inciting the bedlam that ensued at the convention. \"I\\'ve been dealing with Nevada state conventions for 50 years: To say I was disappointed was an understatement,\" Reid told CNN Monday. \"I hold his people accountable, and I\\'m sure if Bernie found out about it, he would not accept what happened there.\" Fears of Philadelphia unrest With Sanders warning that he plans to take his campaign to the July convention in Philadelphia, even if he\\'s trailing Clinton in pledged delegates, Democrats are growing increasingly fearful that what happened in Nevada could be repeated just as the party is struggling to unite after a spirited primary. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois said \"of course\" he\\'s concerned that the same tactics would be replicated in Philadelphia. \"We saw what happened at the Trump rallies, which broke into violence, people punching one another. I don\\'t want to see that happen at the Democratic Party,\" Durbin said in an interview in the Capitol. \"I call on Bernie to say to his supporters: be fervent, be committed but be sensible. Don\\'t engage in any violence.\" Top Democrats say that it is incumbent on Sanders to bring his supporters in the fold -- or risk electing Trump. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat who backs Clinton, said she has never before dealt with more aggressive supporters than Sanders\\' voters. \"It\\'s been interesting to me because I\\'ve never experienced that before and I\\'ve been involved in every presidential campaign since 1976,\" Shaheen said. \"We\\'ve had lots of people who have supported different candidates, and I\\'ve never seen that kind of behavior before.\" Shaheen recalled an event days before the New Hampshire primary in February when Sanders supporters were \"very aggressive,\" \"heckling me and others as we spoke.\" \"That has never happened before,\" Shaheen said. The senator added: \"In this campaign, (Sanders) has gotten a lot of people engaged, he should be able to go through the primaries as he\\'s committed to do -- Hillary Clinton did that in 2008,\" Shaheen said. \"Hopefully, once the nomination is done, then he will endorse the nominee.\"', 'Harry Reid to CNN on Sanders and the Nevada Convention situation: “I am confident [Sanders] will be saying something about this soon … This is a test of leadership … Hopefully, he will do the right thing.” Mark Paustenbach National Press Secretary & Deputy Communications Director Democratic National Committee W: 202.863.8148 paustenbachm@dnc.org From: Paustenbach, Mark Sent: Tuesday, May 17, 2016 2:39 PM To: Debbie Wasserman Schultz Cc: Miranda, Luis; Banfill, Ryan; Tracie Pough; Dacey, Amy Subject: Re: Weaver on CNN re Nevada Roberta Lange on CNN a short time ago calling for Sen.

He begins by saying Sanders supporters should “act in a civil way” but then goes on to hit the state party. Here is a transcript: Jeff Weaver-- … Well, look, the senator has been very clear, people who are supporting the senator should act in a civil way. They should obviously fight within the context, and by fight, I mean contest if there is a convention, they should be there, they should present their case. And then they should let the votes fall where they may. The situation in Nevada is a little bit different. Obviously no context justifies any kinds of threat or violence. But you know, we have been obviously campaigning in Nevada for almost a year, because of, you know, it\\'s one of the early states. The state party there has a lot of problems. They\\'ve run things very poorly. It has been done very undemocratically. And there seems to be an unwillingness on the part of the Nevada democratic party to bring in all of the new people that Bernie Sanders has brought into the process. If you read some of the reports from what went on there, the chair was clearly ignoring votes from the floor at the Clark county democratic convention in Nevada. They tried to arrest their own credentials chair, because she was being too fair to the Sanders people. I mean, it is dysfunctional or worse out there in the Nevada state democratic party. Obviously it is not a reflection of all Democrats in Nevada, but the party hierarchy, there’s a lot of problems there. I mean they had a convention where they didn\\'t have enough chairs for the number of people who were supposed to be there. Obviously you\\'re trying to exclude people if the room is too small for the anticipated audience. So there is a lot of work to be done. We could have a whole show on the Nevada state democratic party. But regardless – Chris Cuomo, CNN-- You\\'re making the same case that Trump seems to be making, the system is set up against Sanders, the Democrats are against him, and that he should run for a third party. Is Trump right? Jeff Weaver-- No, Trump is wrong. You know, we have interacted with state parties all across the country. And some are more fair than others. Some are, I have to say, some are extremely fair. It just happens in Nevada not to be the case.

Why would you do that?” Sanders told The Chronicle Wednesday. “When we have the most grassroots campaign seen in a very long time — with no violence — and then people are suggesting that we will bring violence to the convention in Philadelphia. That’s absurd. That’s a political tactic.” Without mentioning Wasserman Schultz or Boxer by name, Sanders said, “Then you have people comparing us to Donald Trump? That’s bad politics. What we are trying to do is bring people together. That some people booed and yelled and maybe acted inappropriately, we condemn that. But people do have the right to boo.” ------------------------------ In San Jose, Sanders spells out campaign differences with Clinton SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE By Joe Garofoli Bernie Sanders laughed heartily Wednesday afternoon before taking the stage at his rally in San Jose, noting the differences in his California campaign activities compared with his rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, Hillary Clinton. Sanders scheduled two Bay Area rallies Wednesday — he also had a rally in Vallejo Wednesday evening and in between the two made an unannounced stop to join a boisterous crowd of hotel and restaurant employees in San Francisco demanding the right to unionize. Clinton or her husband, former President Bill Clinton, will headline four high-dollar fundraisers in the Bay Area next week. All the events are private and cost from $250 to $27,000 a ticket. “Ha, ha, ha! That says everything about the difference,” Sanders told The Chronicle Wednesday. “Our goal — and I don’t know if we’ll achieve it — is to talk to 200,000 people in California in rallies like this until June 7” — the date of the California primary election. “If you want a candidate who is out working and speaking with people rather than hanging out raising money from millionaires, I think the choice is pretty clear,” the Vermont senator said. While fundraising stops will be part of the Clintons’ next trip to the state, they will also be making several public appearances — as they have also done during recent stops. Hillary Clinton did make public appearances at rallies in Oakland and East Los Angeles during a campaign swing earlier this month. And Bill Clinton headlined public events in San Diego and Los Angeles earlier this month, too. Bill Clinton is expected to be at a rally in San Diego on Saturday when he swings through California for several days starting this weekend, with more public events expected to be on his schedule. Hillary Clinton is also expected to do multiple public events on her next trip through California next week. Hillary for California campaign director Buffy Wicks responded that both Clintons “ have held events across the state this month where they’ve talked to many Californians about the issues on their minds and they look forward to returning this weekend and next week.” A practical purpose For the Sanders campaign, Wednesday’s rallies served a practical purpose. Before the candidate appeared, supporter Wrenn Bunker Koesters urged the crowd from the stage to text the word “volunteer” to a campaign number. That inspired Esdras Ortega to text his desire to volunteer. The rally was the first political event the 20-year-old De Anza College student had ever attended. “I just wanted to come here, hear what he said and pick up a vibe on his speeches and see what people were cheering for and getting excited about,” Ortega said. “This gets me psyched up to volunteer.” It has paid similar dividends nationally. Of people who have attended Sanders’ campaign rallies or town meetings, 67 percent have volunteered and 40 percent of them donated money, Sanders campaign digital director Kenneth Pennington said Wednesday. The public perception is palpable, too, analysts say. “When you raise money like that, you are more accountable to the public at large rather than a small group of donors,” said Daniel G. Newman, co-founder of Maplight, a nonpartisan organization that analyzes the role of money in politics. Newman pointed out that both Clinton and Sanders have promised to do all they could to overturn Citizens United, the Supreme Court decision that paved the way for unlimited campaign contributions. During Wednesday’s rally before 5,500 people at the Santa Clara County Fairgrounds in San Jose, Sanders — often in a hoarse voice — stuck to his stump speech, a critique of how the wealthy have a death grip on America’s political and economic systems. He didn’t attack Clinton directly and saved some of his most pointed jabs for Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee. ‘That will not happen’ “I know that there are many people who are concerned that Donald Trump may become president of the United States. That will not happen,” Sanders said, pointing to how he leads Trump in many national polls. “More important, I believe the American people will reject the basic tenets of what Donald Trump stands for.” Sanders pointed to Nevada casino magnate Sheldon Adelson saying last week he would endorse Trump. “When you have billionaires supporting billionaires, that’s oligarchy,” the candidate said. Sanders steered into a California topic when he addressed a matter likely to be before state voters this fall: legalizing cannabis for adult recreational use. “If I lived in California I would vote yes to legalize marijuana,” Sanders said at the rally, drawing huge cheers. After he left San Jose, Sanders appeared about 4:30 p.m. in the plaza at 101 California near the Le Meridien Hotel to support workers trying to organize there and spoke for about five minutes to a crowd of about 500 people. This time he veered in a very San Francisco issue: homelessness. “Just been in San Francisco for a few hours, and it’s stunning to see people sleeping out in the street,” he said. Following his speech, he waded into the crowd to shake hands with supporters before heading to the evening rally in Vallejo. At Vallejo’s Waterfront Park, Sanders continued hammering on the nation’s wealth inequality while speaking for an hour before a crowd organizers estimated at 5,000 people. And he continued to be boundlessly optimistic about his chances, saying that after winning the Oregon primary Tuesday, “I think we’re going to sweep the West Coast.” Like he did in San Jose, Sanders barely mentioned Clinton and focused his attacks on Trump as a billionaire who, if elected, would perpetuate an economic system that’s rigged against middle- and low-income Americans. In an interview before his San Jose speech, Sanders reacted strongly to criticism of events at the Nevada Democratic Convention over the weekend. His supporters said party organizers had changed the rules of the convention to block them and give an advantage to Clinton. They reacted by causing disruption and threatening the state party chairwoman. But Sanders said concerns about “violence” were overblown and pointed out that “it was a room filled with police officers and nobody was arrested.” Dems criticize campaign Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz called the reaction by the Sanders campaign to the Nevada incident “anything but acceptable,” and California Sen. Barbara Boxer, who was in Nevada, complained of being booed and said she had been concerned for her safety. Other party leaders worried it could be a preview of chaos at the national convention in July in Philadelphia should Sanders not win the nomination. “What I am concerned about is that people in the Democratic Party even raise that as a spectacle. Why would you do that?” Sanders told The Chronicle Wednesday. “When we have the most grassroots campaign seen in a very long time — with no violence — and then people are suggesting that we will bring violence to the convention in Philadelphia. That’s absurd. That’s a political tactic.” Without mentioning Wasserman Schultz or Boxer by name, Sanders said, “Then you have people comparing us to Donald Trump? That’s bad politics. What we are trying to do is bring people together. That some people booed and yelled and maybe acted inappropriately, we condemn that. But people do have the right to boo.” Sanders also pressed for Clinton to fulfill her promise to debate in California. Fox News extended an invitation Wednesday to both campaigns to debate in California and the Sanders campaign noted that The Chronicle has offered to co-host a debate. While the odds remain long for Sanders to capture the Democratic nomination, Matthew Finkelstein, a Vallejo resident wearing a blue Bernie-themed yarmulke to the rally in his city, remained hopeful. “In politics, anything can happen. Sometimes a moment comes together perfectly and a star goes supernova,” Finkelstein said. “Whether or not Bernie wins this contest or he doesn’t, this movement is coming.”', 'Done.

His campaign — for the presidency, anyway — is most likely nearing its end. “We intend to fight for every vote and delegate remaining,” Mr. Sanders said in Washington on Sunday. While he continues to infuriate the Clinton campaign by battling for Mrs. Clinton’s superdelegates, his tone suggests that he’s no longer in it to win. He’s fighting to ensure that all his supporters get a chance to cast a ballot during the primary season ending in June, and most of all, that Democratic leaders pay attention to their views. The Democratic Party and Mrs. Clinton are better off for Mr. Sanders’s presence in this race. His criticism, as Winston Churchill might say, was not agreeable. But it called necessary attention to unhealthy developments in the Democratic Party, including its at-times obliviousness to the lingering economic pain of the middle class and the young, and its drift toward political caution over aspiration. “I like the idea of saying, ‘We can do much more,’ because we can,” Vice President Joseph Biden Jr., who deferred his own presidential hopes this year, said about Mr. Sanders recently. “I don’t think any Democrat’s ever won saying, ‘We can’t think that big.’” To this day, Mr. Sanders’s rallies are lit up by people who say he is the candidate most focused on their struggle for jobs, better health care and debt relief, and most interested in taking action against those who profited while wages for the working class stagnated and their hopes diminished. As President Obama said, Mr. Sanders had “the luxury of being a complete long shot and just letting loose.” Unrealistic, short on details, the populist Mr. Sanders is a wildly gesticulating reminder of how far the Democratic Party, once champion of the underdog, has strayed. He points out the degree to which the party has become captive to economic elites whose agendas don’t necessarily represent the rest of America’s. Mr. Sanders, who raised more than $200 million through small donations, even cast doubt on Democrats’ claims that they need big-money backers to succeed. Mr. Sanders’s unwillingness to compromise has contributed to a thin record of accomplishment over his decades in Congress. While Mrs. Clinton outflanks him on both knowledge and practice of foreign policy, on domestic policy he has forced her to address the impact of trade deals and globalization, spell out her stances on clean energy and oil and gas exploration, and put more meat on her plans for college affordability. He’s exposed her failure to support $15 an hour as a federal minimum wage, and rightly called her out on the Wall Street speeches that earned her millions and her refusal to make the transcripts public. Mr. Sanders has exposed a broad vein of discontent that Democrats cannot ignore. Predictions that Mr. Sanders’s supporters could migrate to Donald Trump in the fall are overstated, despite Mr. Trump’s cynical efforts to woo them. It’s more likely that some simply won’t vote. Mrs. Clinton is betting that many Democrats will be motivated to get to the polls if Mr. Trump is the Republican nominee. But to truly unify the party, Mrs. Clinton and party leaders must work to incorporate Mr. Sanders and what he stands for in the party’s approach to the general election. It would also help to acknowledge that the party has strayed at times from its more aspirational path. Unlike the voices on the Republican side, Mr. Sanders’s has elevated this campaign. The Democratic Party should listen.', 'Madam Chair, There are reports Kasich may suspend his campaign today at 5pm. Here is a statement for your review. Thanks, Mark For Immediate Release May 4, 2016 Contact – DNC Press 202-863-8148 DNC Chair Wasserman Schultz’s Statement on Governor Kasich’s Announcement that he is Suspending his Campaign for President “With Governor Kasich out of the race, any remaining hope the GOP had of concealing its true colors behind his comparatively friendly-faced candidacy has evaporated. But make no mistake, the extreme policies he has long fought for are virtually indistinguishable from those of Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, and the rest of the modern Republican Party. “Under Kasich, Ohio’s job growth has trailed the national average for 40 straight months. He promised to fight any federal increase in the minimum wage. And he has one of the most extreme anti-choice records of any governor in the country, having signed legislation that shut down half the abortion clinics in his state. “For years, Republican leaders have employed a divisive political strategy to compel people to vote out of distrust, suspicion and hate – rewarding those at the top and denigrating women, minorities, the LGBT community and more in the process. The result is the cynical, divided, bickering Republican base we see now. Today, the only energy left in the Republican primary isn’t for anything, and their final contest is already shaping up to be a bitter, petty battle with one camp against Trump, and the other against Cruz. “The contrast couldn’t be more stark. Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are fighting for the American people – for higher wages, for more opportunity, for a level playing field and for a brighter future. Our voters are energized, enthusiastic, and optimistic because our candidates are committed to moving America forward. And that’s why we’re going to win on Election Day in November.” ###', '', 'Harry Reid says Sanders has no path to the nomination WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid says he does not think Bernie Sanders has a path to winning the Democratic presidential nomination.

For a campaign expected to cost more than $1 billion, “I’ll be putting up money, but won’t be completely self-funding, as I did during the primaries,” Mr. Trump said on Wednesday. The New York businessman, who did receive some mostly, small unsolicited donations, lent his campaign $36 million of the $47 million he spent through March. That plan represents a shift for Mr. Trump, who has for months portrayed his Republican opponents as “puppets” for relying on super PACs and taking contributions from wealthy donors that he said came with strings attached. Mr. Trump is planning to use his expansive personal Rolodex to ensure his campaign has the resources to compete against Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton in November, while the campaign will tap into a new base of Trump supporters who aren’t on party rolls, two Trump advisers said. The presumptive Republican nominee, known for operating on a tight budget in a primary where he enjoyed more than $2 billion in free media attention, is also likely to implement a business plan that may be less costly than traditional political campaigns, a senior aide said. The campaign is also beginning to work with the Republican National Committee to set up a joint fundraising vehicle, after his last two rivals—Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov.John Kasich—dropped out in the wake of Mr. Trump’s resounding Indiana win on Tuesday. He plans to actively help the Republican Party and other GOP candidates with fundraising through events, direct-mail and online appeals, an aide said. Beginning to actively solicit donations, while a super PAC backing him also ramps up his activity, means the billionaire will no longer have that club to use against his Democratic opponent in the general election. The move is also likely to put off some Trump supporters, many of whom have said his self-funding makes them trust him more than other politicians.

The Democratic National Committee and state parties are spending about $2 million initially to build coordinated campaigns in eight battleground states with competitive Senate races. The money is being raised by Clinton\\'s campaign through her Hillary Victory Fund, a joint fundraising committee that allows Clinton to raise large checks of more than $350,000 from wealthy donors. Democrats say the coordinated effort, now a staple in presidential campaigns, will try to build up the party\\'s network of field organizers earlier in the election and work more closely with Senate, House and state and local campaigns than in previous election cycles. The fortunes of Clinton and the Democratic Senate candidates are tightly wound. Democrats need a net gain of five seats to recapture control of the Senate, which could be pivotal for Clinton to move her agenda through Congress if she wins the White House. And many Senate candidates could see their futures shaped by Clinton\\'s performance. The DNC has hired a few hundred field staffers and expects to bring on more organizers in the coming months. Many will be shifting over from working on the presidential campaigns of Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who recently laid off hundreds of field staffers. \"This is my third presidential cycle in Ohio and we are actually starting earlier than before,\" said Rebecca Pearcey, campaign manager for former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland, who is challenging Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio. \"The early work will pay off for us this fall.\" The DNC is using the Clinton fund to build up state organizations in Colorado, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Six of the eight states have Republican Senate incumbents and all of the states will be targets for Clinton against Republican Donald Trump. The states also were the key battlegrounds of the 2012 campaign between President Barack Obama and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. Republican officials say their organizing efforts have started much earlier and are more of a focus than in 2012. The Republican National Committee has dispatched more than 200 paid organizers around the country to help the party\\'s candidates. Trump recently formed a similar fundraising partnership with the RNC and select state parties. Republicans noted that list did not include likely battleground states such as Iowa, where Democrats hope to unseat Republican Sen. Charles Grassley, and Arizona, where GOP Sen. John McCain is seeking re-election. \"Clinton has essentially told all but a few Democrat Senate candidates, \\'Good luck out there, you\\'re going to need it,\\'\" said Greg Blair, a spokesman for the Senate Republicans\\' campaign arm. For Democrats, the organizing efforts form the bedrock of their 2016 campaign — registering voters, recruiting volunteers and driving turnout. The campaigns will be run by the DNC and state parties, helped by outside advisers such as former Obama deputy campaign manager Jennifer O\\'Malley Dillon, and coordinate with local, state and federal campaigns. Four of the states with the coordinated campaign are expected to feature women seeking Senate seats — Catherine Cortez Masto in Nevada, Katie McGinty in Pennsylvania, Maggie Hassan in New Hampshire and Deborah Ross in North Carolina — creating the potential for two women atop their state\\'s Democratic ticket. Clinton has pointed to the need to rebuild the Democratic bench and strengthen state parties, noting Democrats\\' struggles in recent mid-term elections. Clinton\\'s Hillary Victory Fund raised more than $46 million for the DNC and state parties through the end of April. The DNC transferred about $1 million to these key states in April and another $1 million in May. The money is used to cover payroll and the expenditures are expected to grow as the campaigns ramp up their activities. Sanders\\' campaign has criticized Clinton\\'s use of the joint fundraising committee, arguing that it has been used to build her donor email lists and direct mail campaigns and evade more restrictive individual limits during the primary. Clinton\\'s campaign says it has followed the rules and the money will help Democrats up and down the ballot. The ground game will be crucial in Florida, which has an Aug. 30 Senate Democratic primary between Rep. Patrick Murphy, the preferred candidate of Senate Democrats, and Rep. Alan Grayson, a liberal favorite who has bucked the party\\'s leadership. The winner will need to quickly pivot to the fall campaign, leaving little time to build a robust field operation on its own. It will also be essential in states like Colorado, where Republican Cory Gardner ousted incumbent Sen. Mark Udall in 2014. This time, Democrats are defending the Senate seat of Michael Bennet. \"We don\\'t want to take anything for granted in Colorado,\" said Rick Palacio, the chairman of the state\\'s Democratic party.

Wasserman Schultz told CNN\\'s Wolf Blitzer that she thought Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid\\'s request that Sanders issue a statement about the chaos \"was enough. Unfortunately, the senator\\'s response was anything but acceptable. It certainly did not condemn his supporters for acting violently or engaging in intimidation tactics and instead added more fuel to the fire.\" Sanders issued a defiant statement Tuesday, knocking Democratic Party leaders in Nevada and threatening national party leaders with potential damage in the general election. \"It is never OK for violence and intimidation to be the response to that frustration. That\\'s what happens with the Trump campaign. We can never resort to the tactics that they engage in,\" Wasserman Schultz said. Sanders supporters shut down the Nevada Democrats\\' convention Saturday, reportedly flinging chairs and sending death threats to the state party chairwoman. But in a statement Tuesday, Sanders accused state party leaders of ramming through rules that he said blocked his supporters and threatened the national party with potentially dire consequences in the general election. In a statement Tuesday afternoon, Sanders accused Nevada party leaders of boxing out his backers and refused to apologize for the chaos for which his campaign has been blamed. Sanders also alleged that shots were fired into his campaign office several months ago, though he did not speculate who was responsible. \"If the Democratic Party is to be successful in November, it is imperative that all state parties treat our campaign supporters with fairness and the respect that they have earned,\" Sanders said. \"At (the Nevada) convention, the Democratic leadership used its power to prevent a fair and transparent process from taking place.\" Sanders also parried accusations of violence by his supporters by saying that they have actually been targeted because of the rough neighborhoods they have worked in. \"When we speak of violence, I should add here that months ago, during the Nevada campaign, shots were fired into my campaign office in Nevada and apartment housing complex my campaign staff lived in was broken into and ransacked,\" Sanders said in the statement. Casino security shut down the convention Saturday night amid a chaotic fight between supporters of Hillary Clinton and Sanders that some worry could presage a showdown at the party\\'s national convention in Philadelphia in just a few months. In a letter sent Monday to national party officials, state party leaders accused the Sanders campaign of inciting violence, although the Sanders campaign denied that allegation. Clinton supporters have claimed to CNN that they have been targeted by Sanders supporters and have repeatedly asked the Vermont senator to control them. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, a Nevadan and Clinton supporter, spoke privately with Sanders before the convention in an attempt to head off any chaos and said afterward that he held Sanders\\' campaign accountable for the chaos. Speaking with CNN\\'s Manu Raju Tuesday afternoon, Reid angrily responded to Sanders\\' statement, saying he thought the Vermont senator would have handled the matter differently. \"Bernie should say something -- not have some silly statement. Bernie is better than that. Bernie should say something -- not have some statement someone else prepared for him,\" Reid said. \"I\\'m surprised by his statement. I thought he was going to do something different.\" The fight comes as Clinton has struggled to secure the Democratic Party nomination. Clinton backers have struggled to find a way to push Sanders out of the race without alienating his base of liberal voters. CNN\\'s Manu Raju contributed to this report.

Bernie Sanders at the July Democratic National Convention — including a large rally planned near the convention’s epicenter. One of the permits is for an event consisting of four days of all-day rallies at FDR Park in support of Mr. Sanders. The city said it expects 30,000 participants, and organizers said in an interview they hope turnout will be much higher. The park is adjacent to the Wells Fargo Center, where many of the Democratic National Convention events will be held — raising the possibility of a large demonstration in support of Mr. Sanders just steps away from where delegates will officially select the Democratic nominee. A growing number of Democrats are concerned the convention could turn out to be divisive and disorderly due to activities planned by Sanders supporters. The city has also granted permits to three smaller demonstrations at Thomas Paine Plaza, a few miles from the Wells Fargo Center. The city says it expects 2,000 to 3,000 participants at those events. The events — which are being organized independent of campaign by supporters of Mr. Sanders — aim to call attention to support the Vermont Senator has received throughout the primary process and push for long-term changes in the way that the Democratic Party nominates candidates. “The whole Bernie movement is an ideology. If Bernie wins the nomination, wins the presidency, that would be amazing. But even if Hillary does win the nomination, the movement has already started,” said Steve Okan Layne, who is helping organize one of the demonstrations. The size, scope and tenor of the events at the convention depend in part on Mr. Sanders himself. Mrs. Clinton has a substantial lead in the delegate count and is likely to clinch the nomination with the declared support of superdelegates before the convention. If Mr. Sanders is looking to maximize his influence at the convention, he could encourage supporters to show up at the convention to make their voices heard on issues like the party platform and future rules. After a chaotic state convention in Nevada where supporters of Mr. Sanders disrupted the event and threatened the state party chairwoman, some Democrats have begun to fear that the Philadelphia convention could potentially be a messy event with a potential for violence. Organizers say they are working with the city to keep the demonstrations peaceful and constructive. “We are marching. If you’re planning on coming here with violence in mind, we don’t want you,” said Bill Taylor, one of the organizers.

The Republican front-runner has had pushback from women’s groups, columnists and on social media since saying on April 26 that the only thing Clinton, a former secretary of state and U.S. senator, had going for her in the race to succeed President Barack Obama was her gender. He stood behind his remarks on Sunday. “I’m my own strategist. I like what I said,” Trump said in interview on “Fox News Sunday.” “The only card she has to play is the woman’s card,” he said of Clinton. “If she were not a woman, she wouldn’t even be in the race.” Trump focused on his probable general-election foe after winning five Republican primary contests on April 26. “If Hillary Clinton were a man, I don’t think she would get 5 percent of the vote,” he said. Clinton took the attack in stride, saying that “if fighting for women’s health care and paid family leave and equal pay is playing the woman card, then deal me in.” The comment was adopted as a Twitter hashtag, #DealMeIn, and she has used the “woman card” as a fundraising meme. Uphill Fight Trump appears to have an uphill fight to win women voters. Gallup’s daily tracking poll for March showed he’s viewed unfavorably by 70 percent of U.S. women and 58 percent of men, and that his unfavorability rating with women has been climbing. Trump angered many women when he said Fox News journalist Megyn Kelly had “blood coming out of her wherever” after she asked him, during a candidates’ debate in August, about derogatory comments he’d made about women over the years. “Trump is clearly taking on a strategy that is marginalizing women,” Stephanie Schriock, president of Emily’s List, a pro-choice political action committee, said on ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday. “Women voters are going to decide this election. And what women voters are looking for are candidates who are supporting equal pay, who are fighting for minimum wage, who are talking about paid family leave.” The real estate mogul said on Sunday that Clinton’s rival for the Democratic nomination, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, has said worse about the former first lady. Trump added that he plans to co-opt some of that rhetoric. Sanders in March said he thought Clinton was unqualified for the Oval Office because she accepted super-PAC money from Wall Street and voted for the war in Iraq. He later backtracked, saying the former New York senator was both qualified and unqualified. “In a sense it’s both,” Sanders said on the campaign trail on April 8.\", 'Harry Reid to CNN on Sanders and the Nevada Convention situation: “I am confident [Sanders] will be saying something about this soon … This is a test of leadership … Hopefully, he will do the right thing.” Mark Paustenbach National Press Secretary & Deputy Communications Director Democratic National Committee W: 202.863.8148 paustenbachm@dnc.org From: Paustenbach, Mark Sent: Tuesday, May 17, 2016 2:39 PM To: Debbie Wasserman Schultz Cc: Miranda, Luis; Banfill, Ryan; Tracie Pough; Dacey, Amy Subject: Re: Weaver on CNN re Nevada Roberta Lange on CNN a short time ago calling for Sen.

They should obviously fight within the context, and by fight, I mean contest if there is a convention, they should be there, they should present their case. And then they should let the votes fall where they may. The situation in Nevada is a little bit different. Obviously no context justifies any kinds of threat or violence. But you know, we have been obviously campaigning in Nevada for almost a year, because of, you know, it\\'s one of the early states. The state party there has a lot of problems. They\\'ve run things very poorly. It has been done very undemocratically. And there seems to be an unwillingness on the part of the Nevada democratic party to bring in all of the new people that Bernie Sanders has brought into the process. If you read some of the reports from what went on there, the chair was clearly ignoring votes from the floor at the Clark county democratic convention in Nevada. They tried to arrest their own credentials chair, because she was being too fair to the Sanders people. I mean, it is dysfunctional or worse out there in the Nevada state democratic party. Obviously it is not a reflection of all Democrats in Nevada, but the party hierarchy, there’s a lot of problems there.

Thanks', 'Donald Trump Holds 15-Point Lead Ahead of Republican Rivals in Indiana Poll The GOP front-runner could cement his position in a state that Cruz has long sought By Janet Hook Updated May 1, 2016 7:25 p.m. ET The home stretch of the long 2016 GOP presidential race is coming into view, and the path to victory is opening wider for front-runner Donald Trump amid signs that he could pick up a big win in Tuesday’s Indiana primary. A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll finds Mr. Trump ahead by 15 points among likely Republican primary voters in Indiana, pointing to a victory that would significantly boost the businessman’s chances of clinching the Republican presidential nomination before the party’s convention in Cleveland. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, his chief rival, continued to voice confidence that he could keep Mr. Trump from getting the 1,237 delegates needed to claim the nomination either before the convention or on the first ballot. But Mr. Cruz needs Indiana’s primary to be a pivot point. “The country is really depending on Indiana to choose the direction of this race,” Mr. Cruz said on NBC, in one of five television appearances broadcast Sunday morning. Mr. Trump said a victory in Indiana would effectively end the contest. “If we win Indiana, it’s over, OK?” he said at a rally in the state on Sunday. If Mr. Trump won all 57 of Indiana’s delegates, he would have 1,012 bound delegates, leaving him 225 short of the magic number. He would then need 49.45% of the bound delegates remaining to be allocated—the first time that figure would drop below 50% for any candidate in the race. The Journal/NBC News/Marist poll released Sunday bolstered the hopes of Trump supporters, showing that 49% of likely Republican primary voters favored Mr. Trump, compared with 34% for Mr. Cruz and 13% for Ohio Gov. John Kasich. The poll also surveyed likely Democratic voters in Indiana and found Hillary Clinton holds a narrow lead, 50% to 46%, over Sen. Bernie Sanders. With Mr. Sanders trailing significantly in the delegate count, the poll result suggests that the outcome in Indiana isn’t likely to change the dynamic of a nomination fight. Mr. Trump has been on a winning streak since his landslide victories in the New York primary two weeks ago and in last week’s five-state round of voting in the Northeast, which some dubbed the “Acela primary” after the Boston-Washington Amtrak train service. “After the Acela primary, there is an aura of inevitability surrounding the Trump and Clinton candidacies,” said Lee M. Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion. Mr. Cruz’s supporters have been hopeful about Indiana because it is a deeply conservative state with an influential community of evangelical Christians, the kind of voters who are part of the Texas senator’s base. Mr. Cruz won the endorsement Friday of the state’s governor, Mike Pence. But Mr. Pence also praised Mr. Trump and hasn’t joined the “stop-Trump” chorus. John Hammond, a Republican National Committee member from Indiana who is neutral in the race, said Mr. Cruz’s organization in the state is superior to that of his rivals, but that it may be no match for Mr. Trump’s unconventional appeal in this unpredictable political year. “This appears to me to be a state that Trump is going to win,” said Mr. Hammond. “If Cruz does not pick up a significant number of delegates and win statewide, it makes it very difficult to see any way to stop Trump.” A candidate could sweep all 57 delegates in Indiana by winning the vote statewide and in all nine congressional districts. Even if Mr. Trump were to do that, he still would need to wait until June 7, the last day of the primary season, to secure the needed 1,237 delegates. Five states vote then, including California, with its trove of 172 delegates. That is where Mr. Cruz’s sights are turned, win or lose in Indiana. He spoke to California’s GOP convention Saturday and picked up the endorsement of former Republican Gov. Pete Wilson. The Cruz campaign has also continued to work at state conventions to ensure his supporters fill delegate slots, even if they are bound to vote for Mr. Trump on the first convention ballot. His team scored another such victory in Arizona. Mr. Trump had won the state’s primary, but a state GOP convention on Saturday placed Cruz supporters in most of the state’s 58 delegate slots. Among the Trump backers who lost out was former Gov. Jan Brewer. There was no such Cruz takeover at Delaware’s state GOP convention Saturday, which approved a slate of 16 delegates. Most who spoke seemed prepared to back Mr. Trump beyond the first ballot, because he had won more than 60% of the vote in the state’s primary, according to John Fluharty, manager of the GOP state convention. “The delegates heard the primary voters loud and clear,” Mr. Fluharty said.

WASHINGTON POSTLiberal pundits blame Debbie Wasserman Schultz, not Bernie Sanders, for Democrats’ divisionBy Callum Borchers Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz says Bernie Sanders added fuel to the fire that raged at last weekend’s chaotic Democratic convention in Nevada, criticizing him for choosing to denounce party leaders before condemning violence in a written statement. Liberal CNN commentator Van Jones sees things very differently. “She says that Bernie\\'s adding fuel to the fire? She just added fuel to the fire,” Jones said Tuesday, shortly after Wasserman Schultz said in an interview that Sanders\\'s response to reports of a scuffle and threatening behavior by some of his supporters was \"anything but acceptable.\" Jones went on: The problem that we have right now is that there has been this concern on the part of Bernie\\'s people that the DNC has been on Hillary\\'s side. ... First of all, Bernie did say, in his statement, that he\\'s against the violence. Also, if you want to talk about violence, only one person\\'s been arrested — it was a Hillary Clinton supporter, Wendell Pierce, arrested for assaulting a Sanders supporter. So, if you\\'re going to come out and you\\'re going to talk about violence and you\\'re the DNC chair, you have to be fair about it. I don\\'t think she was fair. I think she actually made it worse now. We have to pull these people together. That did not happen. (Pierce, we should note, is the former \"The Wire\" actor who was arrested over the weekend after an incident at an Atlanta hotel. There were no arrests at the Nevada convention.) MSNBC’s Mika Brzezinski went farther than Jones on Wednesday, calling for Wasserman Schultz to resign. \"This has been very poorly handled from the start,\" Brzezinski said. \"It has been unfair, and they haven’t taken him seriously, and it starts, quite frankly, with the person that we just heard speaking [Wasserman Schultz]. It just does. ... She should step down. She should step down.\" Fellow MSNBC host Chris Hayes, meanwhile, said Tuesday that it\\'s clear that Wasserman Schultz\\'s fingers are on the scale. “It is clearly the case that when given truth serum, Debbie Wasserman Schultz vastly prefers Hillary Clinton to be the nominee, obviously, and to the extent that there are things that can be done institutionally and marginally to facilitate that outcome, they are being done,\" Hayes said. As the Democratic presidential nominating contest drags on — with the Republican race already over — left-leaning pundits are increasingly pinning the blame for disunity on the party boss, instead of the underdog candidate who refuses to drop out. Sanders might be stubborn, but Wasserman Schultz drove him to it by favoring Clinton from the start. Or so the argument goes. And the situation in Nevada seems to have turned up the heat on some long-simmering tensions. Top complaints include briefly suspending the Sanders campaign\\'s access to a voter database and scheduling half as many primary debates (six) as the Republicans did — and putting half of those events on weekend nights, allegedly to minimize exposure and insulate the front-runner. The database suspension was a penalty imposed after Sanders acknowledged that a staffer improperly exploited a software glitch that allowed him to view confidential voter information held by the Clinton campaign. The DNC eventually sanctioned four additional debates, though only three have been held and there is no date for the fourth. The left side of the media has been criticizing Wasserman Schultz\\'s handling of the primary process for a while. \"Fire Debbie Wasserman Schultz,\" blared a to-the-point headline on the Huffington Post in December. On the same day, Slate declared that \"Debbie Wasserman Schultz is acting just like the villain Bernie Sanders says she is.\" More recently, Esquire\\'s Charles P. Pierce called for Wasserman Schultz\\'s ouster in March (though for reasons unrelated to the 2016 primary), The liberal press isn\\'t alone in its frustration.

Sanders made the Democratic race far more competitive than anyone imagined. But as he delays the inevitable, Wasserman Schultz finds that she, too, is being cast as a divisive figure by the media. On top of it all, the perception could be virtually impossible to shake. While Sanders will ultimately be judged by the extent to which he rallies supporters to Clinton in the general election, Wasserman Schultz is already being judged by moves she made early in the primary season that can\\'t be reversed.

So as far as unity goes, both of our candidates know how important it is that we don’t allow a Republican to drag our country backward, particularly one as extreme and dangerous as Trump or Cruz, both of whom frankly have proven they don’t have the judgment or temperament to serve as President. And just as important, Because the Party’s platform is a statement of our values, the DNC is committed to an open, inclusive and representative process. Both of our campaigns will be represented on the Platform Drafting Committee, and just as we did in 2008 and 2012, the public will have opportunities to participate. So we’re confident we’ll be united in Philadelphia and have the strongest candidate in November. >>> 4.26.16 TALKING POINTS Topline Message: Today as millions of Americans in five states go to the polls, Democrats are voting with enthusiasm for the candidate they like most -- Republicans are holding their noses and casting their votes for the candidate they dislike least. We expect that today we’ll see the same thing we’ve seen throughout this campaign, our voters are energized with the serious and substantive primary we’ve had and two candidates who both have the judgment and temperament to serve; while Republican voters will continue to be dismayed with the chaos on their side. · In the last primary in New York, exit polls showed that nearly 7 out of every 10 Democratic voters believe that our primary has energized our party. · That’s because our two candidates have consistently offered strong, well thought-out visions for our country that would move America forward. · That’s consistent with Wisconsin where 7 out of 10 Democrats in those exit polls said they were excited or optimistic about both of our candidates. · That’s something we’re not seeing on the Republican side where serious questions have been raised about their understanding of the issues, not to mention their judgment and temperament given how ugly, divisive and insulting they’ve been. · Their own voters know it. Just 39% of Republicans in New York thought their campaign has energized their party. In Wisconsin 4 out of 10 Republican primary voters…let me say that again…Republican primary voters said they fear what a Trump presidency would do to our country. And roughly a third would rather stay home, vote for a third party, or vote for a Democrat than support either Trump or Cruz. · That’s stunning, but it tells you that Democrats are heading into November in a far stronger position than Republicans. Update: Sanders Argued This Morning on CNN/New Day: · There is a Narrow Path to Victory: We have won 16 states so far and I'm looking forward to winning a number more. I think we have a path to victory and will fight this until the last vote is cast. … It's a narrow path, but do have a path, and the idea that we should not contest in California or a larger state, let the people of California determine what the agenda of the democratic party is and who the candidate for president should be is pretty crazy. So we're in this to the end. · I am a Strong General Election Candidate; Super Delegates May Ultimately Decide That’s Most Important: And I think that when you look at national polling, where in virtually every national and statewide poll, Bernie Sanders runs a lot better against Donald Trump and other Republican candidates than does Hillary Clinton. I think you've got super delegates there who say, you know what? We need a strong candidate. We need a candidate who can beat trump, maybe Bernie Sanders is that candidate. · At the Convention, We Will Push for Our Issues to be on the Platform: I think what the democratic process is about, Chris, is going to the convention and arguing about what the platform should be. … The winner, whether it is Secretary Clinton or myself, our job is then to go out to the American people on a platform that makes sense to the working families of this country, and then we win with a large voter turnout. Talking Points Chaos in Cleveland vs Our Next President in Philadelphia We’re less than 100 days from the July conventions, and it’s clear that Democrats will emerge united, while Republicans are embroiled in drama better suited for a reality show than a contest for the presidency. Both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are dedicated to supporting the eventual Democratic nominee. · Just yesterday, Senator Sanders said at a town hall on MSNBC that he will do everything in his power to make sure no Republican gets into the White House in November. · And Secretary Clinton has been clear about her commitment to unifying the party and the need to build on the progress we’ve made under Democratic leadership over the last 7 years. · Because the Party’s platform is a statement of our values, the DNC is committed to an open, inclusive and representative process. Both of our campaigns will be represented on the Platform Drafting Committee, and just as we did in 2008 and 2012, the public will have opportunities to participate. Democrats know that we’re stronger when more voices are heard, and when we stand together to move our country forward, we’ll see that in Philadelphia at our convention. Compare that to the Republicans. · This week, the increasingly desperate Cruz and Kasich campaigns forged an unusual alliance to stop Trump, but it barely lasted as long as the announcement that it was happening. · A majority of Trump supporters said they would abandon the Republican Party if he loses the nomination and runs as a third-party candidate. · Even Republican leaders are afraid of going near their radioactive convention. You’ve already seen Republican candidates in tight races, like Senator Kirk in Illinois and John McCain – the GOP nominee eight years ago – say they will not attend their own convention in Cleveland. But don’t let them fool you, they’re not any better than the top of their ticket. Joint Fundraising Committees · We welcome any effort by our candidates to help raise money for the DNC and state parties, which is why stood up similar agreements for joint victory funds with both the Clinton campaign and the Sanders campaign early in the cycle. · The DNC is the only entity that will be able to closely coordinate with our eventual nominee, and we took these important steps because of the urgency to build a strong national infrastructure NOW that will help elect Democrats up and down the ballot in November. · It’s important to note, the funds that the DNC and state parties get through the joint victory funds help strengthen, for example, our national voter file and communications, research and digital support for state parties and down ballot candidates. That includes training across a variety of areas, for example, and access to media monitoring and rapid response support. This is helping us build infrastructure for the general election. · These arrangements are not new or unusual. Similar joint fundraising committees were established with our Democratic candidate in both 2008 and 2012. And again, both campaigns have signed on and have the option of using joint victory funds. · And let’s be clear, neither the DNC nor state parties are subsidizing fundraising through these committees for either campaign. For whatever each campaign raises under the agreement that then goes to their campaign, that campaign pays a directly proportional amount for the cost of that fundraising. Contested Convention / Arizona Lawsuit · We’re going to be united at our convention, and we’re confident in our process, which was in place well before we knew who would run this cycle and which has been fair to all of our candidates. · We’ve cautioned our candidates to maintain a tone that helps us build toward the general election, recognizing that as we funnel down the home stretch of any campaign the intensity level will rise. · Ultimately, Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders are drawing sharp differences with one another, but their differences remain focused on how to best move America forward. · They’re focused on how to make sure our government reflects the values of the American people, that we have an economy and a democracy that are inclusive, and that we respect everyone in America. · If you want to talk about a rigged process, we’re doing that too. The Democratic National Committee and our Senatorial Campaign Committee are suing officials in Arizona whose decisions led to voters having to wait for hours to vote during their March primaries, and many to be disenfranchised as a result. We want to make sure that doesn’t happen in November. · If you want to talk about rigging elections, that’s the real example, and it’s a serious problem and we’re glad both our candidates have expressed interest addressing attempts to make it harder for the American people to vote. · In Maricopa County, officials reduced the number of polling locations to just 1 for every 21,000 people. That’s seven times what it was in other parts of the state, and it shows you the magnitude of the efforts to make it harder to vote that Republicans are championing all across the country. · And it’s not just Arizona, you had a member of Congress from Wisconsin, Glenn Grothman, who flat out said that they expected they could now win Wisconsin because of the Voter ID law. It was his Kevin McCarthy moment, and the type of rigging of the system we’re not going to put up with. · When voters go to the polls in November, they can be certain that the Democratic nominee will have the temperament and judgment to serve as commander in chief, and that's not something you can say about the Republican candidates. Clinton’s Speeches and Sanders’ Taxes · Our job at the Party isn’t to handicap our own primary, we’re not going to referee. · There are real differences, but they’re with the Republicans, and while you have to expect that the candidates are going to draw sharp differences, they’re also highlighting what a much better option voters have with Democrats. · Just look at the issue of taxes as millions of Americans filed last week, but most of them didn’t get to take advantage of special loopholes or get special breaks. Yet every single Republican plan for the economy is based on tax cuts for those at the very top of the income scale. It’s exactly the economic policy that the Bush Administration had as they drove us toward the great recession. · So ultimately those are the differences that will matter most in November. GOP Frontrunner Trump is Reckless and Dangerous · The Economy: Trump’s unfounded predictions of recession and warnings against investing in the stock market are reckless, and economists have already predicted his policies could start an international trade war and cause a global recession. · Foreign Policy: Trump’s threat to pull back from our most important military alliances in NATO sends a dangerous message, which is particularly troubling in light of his past praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin. · Nuclear Proliferation: Trump has refused to say he wouldn’t use nuclear weapons on European territory, then suggested South Korea and Japan should either develop nuclear weapons or pay the United States for protection against North Korea. · On abortion: Trump has taken multiple positions on abortion - from a dangerous and offensive call to punish women who get an abortion, to saying he would allow states to restrict women’s rights, to saying abortion laws are set but he would eliminate them with judicial appointments. Cruz · The vast majority of his Republican colleagues can barely muster a straight face to say anything nice or positive about him! · Lindsey Graham crassly talked about how no one in the Senate would object if he was killed on the Senate floor, and said that endorsing him over Trump was the equivalent of choosing to get poisoned over being shot. · Senator Jim Risch of Idaho – TWICE – gave one of the most passive, non-endorsement endorsements I’ve ever seen. · It’s going to be very difficult for Senators and Congress members to run alongside a presidential nominee they really don’t like! The GOP’s Problem with Women Voters Trump is viewed unfavorably by 7 out of 10 women, but both of his primary opponents would also alienate women voters with their policies as the nominee. · Kasich said that he wants to see Roe v. Wade repealed, and when asked what kind of punishment that would lead to, he evaded the question by saying that it should be left to the states. · Cruz said that even if a woman has been brutally raped, she should be forced to carry the pregnancy caused by her attacker to term. · In the past, the Republican candidates have opposed equal pay, family leave, and voted against the Violence Against Women Act. Earlier this month we marked Equal Pay Day, the day in 2016 when women’s earnings have caught up with men’s earnings from 2015. On average we earn 79 cents to their dollar, and it’s worse for women of color. All of the Republican presidential candidates would stand against protections that ensure greater equality in the workplace. · John Kasich has consistently belittled women and said that we don’t need workplace protections, just a ‘change of heart’ among major employers. · Ted Cruz voted against the Paycheck Fairness Act three times and ridiculed the legislation as a ‘show vote.’ · Donald Trump stated that women would have pay equity if we did ‘as good a job’ as men. Republicans to Blame for Trump and His Down Ballot Impact It’s fitting that Donald Trump is the standard-bearer of a party that has relied on divisive politics and scapegoating for electoral gain for so long. Since 2004 they’ve used gay marriage as a wedge issue, demonized immigrants and stoked fears about border security. They’ve given birthers like Trump a pass, and fueled the Tea Party with lies about a total government takeover of healthcare and the economy. Then while in office, the only thing Republicans have done in Washington over the last seven years is obstruct. Trump IS the Republican Party. Advantage, Democrats Despite all the media attention that Republican frontrunner Trump gets with his say-anything strategy, Democrats are winning where it matters. · Senator Clinton has earned more than 10 million votes – Over a million more than Donald Trump – while Senator Sanders has earned more than 8 million votes (well ahead of Ted Cruz and John Kasich), while also garnering more than seven million individual campaign contributions from low dollar donors. If there is an enthusiasm gap, it clearly favors Democrats. · Overall fundraising shows a Democratic edge, with Democrats raising a total of $72.1 million in February and 67.5 million in March, eclipsing Republicans’ fundraising, which amounted to less than $12 million for Cruz, $6 million for Trump, and just $3.4 million for Kasich in February. · And while Trump continues to claim that he is self-funding his campaign, his latest report with the FEC shows that he has loaned his campaign $24 million throughout this election cycle, while he raising just $34 million from outside contributors and loans for the entire cycle. · Democrats will have the strongest candidate in November. Period. And we are poised to take back the Senate and make serious gains in the House. Broad Contrast and Infrastructure · We have been building an infrastructure and operation that will work regardless of who the Republicans nominate. We see the numbers of course; it’s clear Trump is far ahead of his competitors, and we’re ready for him if he makes it through what is shaping up to be a train wreck of a convention. · But we don’t think taking on Trump is fundamentally different from any of the others. · At least with Trump, he’s not shy about exposing what the Republican brand has truly become. Ted Cruz and John Kasich are every bit as extreme as their party’s front-runner, they just hide it a bit better. · They promise the same extreme agenda on women’s rights, they deny the threat of climate change, and they oppose fixing a broken immigration system with a path to citizenship. · They all want to drag America back to the failed economic policies of the last Republican president who left office losing 800,000 jobs a month and having plunged our country into the Great Recession. · And they’ve all been just as offensive in their rhetoric, using language that alienates our allies, helps ISIS recruit terrorists, and makes America less safe. · So if it is Trump, we’re ready. Maybe it’s Cruz, but it’s hard to see how that comes together in the end. But regardless we’re building a ground game and an infrastructure that’s ready to challenge him on every single position he’s taking on the campaign trail, and that holds him accountable for what those positions would actually mean for the American people.

For Immediate Release May 3, 2016 Contact: DNC Press – 202-863-8148 DNC Chair Statement on Tonight’s Primary Results WASHINGTON - DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz issued the following statement on tonight’s Indiana primary results: “Tonight’s results in Indiana are the culmination of what can only be described as a disastrous week for the Republican Party. Clearly the GOP’s problems go well beyond their convention. “In just seven days, Republicans saw their former House Speaker call one of their candidates ‘Lucifer in the flesh,’ watched a desperate, mathematically-eliminated campaign announce a Vice Presidential pick and get ridiculed for it, and then kicked off the Indiana primaries this morning with accusations that Ted Cruz’s father was tied to Lee Harvey Oswald. The absurdity of that last allegation was compounded by the fact that Dangerous Donald Trump, who is just a hair’s-breadth away from securing the Republican nomination, based it on a tabloid story he saw in the National Enquirer. “No wonder the Republican Party is less popular than it’s been in more than two decades. Just today, exit polls in Indiana showed that 53 percent of Indiana primary Republican voters say they feel betrayed by the Republican Party. And in recent weeks, exit polls in primary after primary have shown that a majority of Republican voters believe their primary has been divisive, with as much as a third preferring to either stay home or vote for an alternative, rather than voting for their eventual nominee. “Meanwhile, Democratic voters are proud of their candidates and it shows each time they go to the polls. Last week, in Connecticut and Pennsylvania respectively, 67% and 71% of Democrats reported feeling energized by our primary. Today in Indiana it was three-quarters of Democratic voters who said our primary has energized our party, and a majority of Democrats who voted today expressed support for either one of our candidates. “Today it’s clearer than ever that none of the Republican candidates has the judgment or temperament to serve as our Commander in Chief.

Debbie Wasserman Schultz today issued the following statement on a letter from the Nevada Democratic Party regarding threatening and violent behavior among some participants around their state party convention this weekend: “We are deeply concerned about the troubling details laid out in the letter from the Nevada Democratic Party. We will be reaching out to the leadership of both of our campaigns to ask them to stand with the Democratic Party in denouncing the type of behavior on display over the weekend in Las Vegas. Our democracy is undermined any time threats, intimidation, physical violence or damage to property are present. If there are legitimate concerns, they must be addressed in an orderly, civil and peaceful manner. “The rules governing the Democratic Party delegate selection process have been in place for decades and the specific procedures for this cycle were agreed upon in 2014.

Bernie Sanders’ campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, on Monday criticized a Hillary Clinton campaign fundraising scheme that state party leaders told Politico has been used as a self-serving “money-laundering\" conduit. Despite Clinton’s pledges to rebuild state parties, Politico found that less than 1 percent of the $61 million raised by the Victory Fund has stayed in the state parties’ coffers. “Secretary Clinton is looting funds meant for the state parties to skirt fundraising limits on her presidential campaign,” Weaver said. “We think the Clinton campaign should let the state parties keep their fair share of the cash.” Sanders’ and Clinton’s primary campaigns both raised about $26 million in April, but Politico documented how the Hillary Victory Fund, a supposedly joint fundraising committee, has been exploited to inflate her presidential primary campaign. “Secretary Clinton has exploited the rules in ways that let her high-dollar donors like Alice Walton of Wal-Mart fame and the actor George Clooney and his super-rich Hollywood friends skirt legal limits on campaign contributions,” Weaver added. “If Secretary Clinton can\\'t raise the funds needed to run in a competitive primary without resorting to laundering, how will she compete against Donald Trump in a general election?” The Sanders campaign first raised questions about the arrangement in an April 18 letter from Brad Deutsch, the attorney for Sanders’ campaign, to U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the chair of the DNC. \"Hillary Clinton says that campaign finance reform is one of the most important issues facing our country but her campaign\\'s use of the Victory Fund to essentially launder money proves otherwise,\" Weaver said. \"You cannot exploit a broken campaign finance system one day and vow to get big money out of politics the next.\" Sanders last month raised money for three progressive Democratic candidates for the House of Representatives. Unlike the Hillary Victory Fund, every dollar went directly to helping the candidates. The senator has also raised significant sums for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. ### Paid for by Bernie 2016 PO Box 905 - Burlington, Vermont 05402, United States', 'Nevada article has been fixed to at least not implicate the DNC the way it did before: From: Garcia, Walter Sent: Monday, May 16, 2016 1:00 PM To: Miranda, Luis Cc: Patrice Taylor; Paustenbach, Mark; Federico, Courtney; Dacey, Amy Subject: RE: Chaos At Nevada Democratic Convention; DNC Leaders Flee Building As Sanders Supporters Demand Recount | Video | RealClearPolitics Full updated article below.

Bernie Sanders faces a ‘then what’ problem 05/19/16 08:53 AM—UPDATED 05/19/16 08:55 AM facebook twitter 1 save share group 93 By Steve Benen It’s safe to say May hasn’t gone quite as well as Bernie Sanders and his supporters had hoped. He needed landslide victories in several primaries, and he came up short. After steadily gaining on Hillary Clinton in national Democratic polls for months, the senator has seen his support slip in recent weeks. In Nevada, Sanders’ supporters caused a near-riot at the state Democratic convention, based on allegations of party wrongdoing that have struggled to withstand scrutiny. Sanders’ candidacy has had some highs and some lows, but all things considered, this hasn’t exactly been a month to remember. For his legions of supporters, it’s no doubt discouraging. The race for the Democratic nomination, however, still has about a month to go, and the New York Times reports that Team Sanders isn’t backing down, delegate arithmetic notwithstanding. Defiant and determined to transform the Democratic Party, Senator Bernie Sanders is opening a two-month phase of his presidential campaign aimed at inflicting a heavy blow on Hillary Clinton in California and amassing enough leverage to advance his agenda at the convention in July – or even wrest the nomination from her. It’s at this point when Sanders and campaign operation start to run into a “then what?” problem. According to the Times’ piece, for example, Team Sanders believes it may yet win the California primary, where polls show him trailing, which might have “a psychological impact” on Democrats. OK, but then what? If the idea is that Democratic insiders will ignore the will of the voters and the delegate count because of one primary result, awarding Sanders the nomination despite his second-place finish, there’s no reason to believe such a scenario is plausible. The same article said Team Sanders is willing to hurt Clinton, on purpose, even as the general-election phase gets underway. OK, but then what? There’s still no reason to believe this will prompt party officials to override the primary and caucus results. A Sanders supporter told the Times, “We want to have progressive values and socialism on the convention’s agenda.” OK, but then what? It’s not clear how, exactly, one puts “socialism” on the “agenda,” but even if that were possible, what happens afterwards? Tad Devine, a top Sanders strategist, told the Washington Post’s Greg Sargent yesterday that the Sanders campaign may ask for some changes among convention committee assignments. OK, but then what? What are the practical effects of changing which Democrats sit on which convention committees, and why should a second-place candidate dictate convention committees’ membership? There are rumors about Sanders supporters preparing for civil disobedience and organized disruptions at the Democratic convention itself. OK, but then what? History has shown that convention protests, even intra-party protests, can lead to meaningful change, but even if progressive activists literally started fires on the convention floor, in a display of violent catharsis, how does that bring Sanders and his allies any closer to their goals? The Times article added this key paragraph: [Sanders’] newly resolute attitude is also the cumulative result of months of anger at the national Democratic Party over a debate schedule that his campaign said favored Mrs. Clinton; a fund-raising arrangement between the party and the Clinton campaign; the appointment of fierce Clinton partisans as leaders of important convention committees; and the party’s rebuke of Mr. Sanders on Tuesday for not clearly condemning a melee at the Nevada Democratic convention on Saturday. It’s worth noting, however, that the national Democratic Party agreed to expand the debate schedule, and it offered Sanders literally the identical fundraising arrangement it struck with the Clinton campaign. Democratic officials also worked to make sure Sanders appeared on the New Hampshire and D.C. primary ballots, even after procedural and legal questions arose surrounding his eligibility – steps the DNC wouldn’t have taken if it were trying to rig the process against him. There’s still time to avoid scenarios that could prove costly in the fall, but not a lot of time. Sanders believes, accurately, that he has some leverage: if he’s not satisfied with how the process unfolds in the coming weeks, the senator can sabotage the party’s ticket and elect President Trump.

Bernie Sanders on Friday urged Democratic Party Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz not to stack the committees that will draft the rules and lay out the party platform at this summer’s Democratic National Convention. In a letter to the party chairwoman, Sanders said the makeup of the standing committees should reflect the relative level of support that he and Hillary Clinton received in primaries and caucuses. So far, Sanders has won about 45 percent of the pledged delegates. Both campaigns deserve a say at the convention this July in Philadelphia, the senator said. Under party rules, Wasserman Schultz recommends 25 at-large appointments to the party’s executive committee for each of the three standing committees; rules, platform and credentials. Wasserman Schultz has forwarded only three of 40 names the Sanders campaign recommended for the key committees while installing Clinton loyalists in leading roles. Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy was put in charge of the Platform Committee, for example, and former Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts was tapped to head the Rules Committee. Sanders called Malloy and Frank “aggressive attack surrogates” for Clinton. He doubted that either would “conduct committee proceeding in an even-handed manner” and said the appointments of the two Clinton loyalists “suggests the standing committees are being established in an overtly partisan way meant to exclude the input of the voters who have supported my candidacy.” How the party leadership comports itself at the convention will affect Democrats’ chances of winning the general election this November, the Vermont senator said. “If we are to have a unified party in the fall, no matter who wins the nomination, we cannot have a Democratic National Convention in which the views of millions of people who participated in the Democratic nominating process are unrepresented in the committee membership. That sends the very real message that the Democratic Party is not open to the millions of new people that our campaign has brought into the political process, does not want to hear new voices and is unwilling to respect the broader base of people that this party needs to win over in November and beyond,” Sanders wrote to Wasserman Schultz. The letter warned that if committee assignments aren't fairly allotted one result could be floor fights. Under party rules, minority reports may be brought before the full convention at the request of 25 percent of the platform, credentials and rules committees. “If the process is set up to produce an unfair, one-sided result, we are prepared to mobilize our delegates to force as many votes as necessary to amend the platform and rules on the floor of the convention,” Sanders wrote.

KMEX -- UNIVISION LOS ANGELES WATCH HERE UNIVISION – UNIVISION LOS ANGELES WATCH HERE Media’s Trump Coverage ‘Needs to Be Balanced’ In General Election, Says DNC Chair VARIETY // TED JOHNSON Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz said that she expects that the “outrageously imbalanced” news media coverage of Donald Trump will “begin to even out” as the race heads to the general election. In an interview with Variety on Wednesday, Wasserman Schultz said that the general election will present a different dynamic because it will be a head-to-head matchup, versus the GOP primary when Trump dominated coverage against 16 other opponents. She said that the DNC “will be pushing for accountability when it comes to the media’s coverage of this campaign from our perspective. The opportunities should be essentially even, and so it is my hope and our expectation that the coverage would begin to even out, and you not allow what they allowed to play out during the primary. And I expect that they will be more responsible about it than they have.” Analytics firm MediaQuant valued Trump’s earned media coverage at $2.8 billion, compared to $1.2 billion for Hillary Clinton, $770.7 million for Ted Cruz and $658 million for Bernie Sanders. The figures are for 12 months ended April 30. The Trump coverage, she said, has “kind of been outrageously imbalanced.” Still, Wasserman Schultz said that it was “not for us to dictate” whether news networks conduct phone interviews with Trump, as opposed to in-studio or on camera interviews. Clinton has conducted phoners too, but news networks have been criticized for the extent to which they have featured Trump by audio only. “I am just talking about the coverage needs to be balanced, and they can’t just focus on ratings, and they need to focus on making sure that they present a fair opportunity that is presented to them without being mindful that there is a candidate on the other side,” she said. Wasserman Schultz was at the headquarters of the Los Angeles County Democratic Party, the day after Trump trounced Cruz in the Indiana primary and Cruz dropped out. Trump’s remaining rival, John Kasich, abandoned his bid on Wednesday, making Trump the presumptive nominee. Wasserman Schultz called Trump an “abomination.” “Donald Trump is the Republican party,” Wasserman Schultz said. “…So any comparison of Donald Trump being able to vanquish his opponents in the primary to he general election are really completely comparing apples and oranges. Donald Trump’s success has proven that this is where the Republican party of today is. They are right wing and extreme. They support misogyny. They are willing to support the most bigoted, sexist, misogynistic bully that has campaigned for the presidency in modern times. And that certainly is not where a majority of Americans are.” Still, she said that she agrees with pundits and analysts who say that Trump should not be underestimated. “We are a divided nation,” she said. “We are going to take this election very seriously, unlike Republicans, who laughed Donald Trump off for far too long. We have been assuming for many months that he would be their nominee, have been preparing for him to be their nominee, and we will be running this election as if it were a down-to-the-wire close election.” The race between Clinton and Sanders has gotten heated, while the expectation had been that the Democrats would wrap up their primary race before the Republicans did. Instead, Sanders won Indiana’s primary, although it didn’t put much of a dent in Clinton’s delegate lead. Wasserman Schultz said that she was “confident” of party unity. “On our side, compared to 2008, this is a relatively tame back and forth,” Wasserman Schultz said. “Go back and watch some of the acrimony between Obama and Clinton at this point. The election was much closer, and you had a lot more acrimony. Surrogates were on TV trashing the other. And not only did we reunify even though it played out through the primaries, President Obama eventually asked Senator Clinton to be his secretary of state.” Wasserman Schultz said that she has “cautioned the candidates at this stage of the campaign to be mindful of tone,” but she also noted that each candidate has vowed to support the other in the general election. Instead, she said that it is Republicans who “have a real problem with unity” based on sentiments expressed by some conservatives on social media who say they will never back Trump. She said that they would be reaching out to Republicans to support the Democratic nominee. “There are a number coming out publicly on their own,” she said. “We always do, but we see many more than usual on the Republican side who are actually saying they will not only go to the polls and vote for our candidate but will be willing to work for our candidate.” She predicted that there will be more voter interest in the Democratic National Convention than the Republican gathering, which she said is “going to be a circus.” “They are about to nominate the most extreme, racist, sexist, bigoted, misogynist in modern times,” she said. “So watching their convention play out will be more like watching a train wreck. You shouldn’t do it, but you can’t help yourself.” She added, “If you look comparatively at 2012, the Republican National Convention, with a so-called establishment nominee, ended with Clint Eastwood talking to an empty chair.” She said that this years DNC “will be such a clear and stark contrast about the choice that voters will have in being able to move us forward and focus on the future or be dragged backwards and worse.” Wasserman Schultz said that she expected the electoral map to look like it did in 2012, although she pointed to demographic shifts and expected turnout from voters alarmed at the prospect of Trump being elected. Although California is reliably blue, she pointed to 14,000 new Democrats registered in Orange County, a traditional conservative bastion. “They are generating interest on our side simply because of how badly [the Republicans] are alienating large groups of voters,” she said. Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders bring Democratic battle to California LA DAILY NEWS // DAVID MONTERO Welcome to what battleground state status feels like, California Democrats. At least for a little while. Just hours after Indiana sent Sen. Ted Cruz packing and Ohio Gov. John Kasich called it quits, essentially making Donald Trump the presumptive Republican nominee for president, the Democrats found they were the ones in the middle of the political drama, with their front-runner being chased by a challenger who not only won in the Hoosier State but has vowed to keep fighting through California’s June 7 primary. Bernie Sanders may be a mathematical long shot to get the Democratic presidential nomination, despite winning the Indiana primary Tuesday, but Hillary Clinton isn’t taking chances and has begun flooding California with rallies, office openings and fundraisers. The tussle between Clinton and Sanders for the state’s 475 delegates started in earnest today, as early primary voting gets underway Monday. Former President Bill Clinton spoke in Los Angeles on behalf of his wife at the Grand Suite Hotel on Wednesday before participating in a panel discussion about gun violence with members of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and actor Brad Pitt in the evening. His appearances in Southern California also included a speech in San Diego. The former president is also participating in a fundraiser this week and will deliver the commencement speech for undergraduates at Loyola Marymont University on Saturday. Meanwhile, Sanders had surrogates speaking for him at UC Irvine and Cal State Long Beach on Wednesday, a move that played to his popularity among college-age millennials. He went Hollywood with the move, tapping actors Kendrick Sampson of “How to Get Away With Murder,” Heather Matarazzo of “The Princess Diaries” and Oscar winner Susan Sarandon. Coming into Los Angeles on Wednesday to see the Golden State shuffle was Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who said she preferred her position of watching two of her party’s candidates duel for the nomination rather than the task facing her Republican counterpart, Reince Priebus. “I’ve never seen so much churn and angst and opposition to the presumptive nominee from a political party like what is taking place here,” she said in an interview at the Los Angeles County Democratic Party headquarters. “You know they have a massive problem on their hands.” When Cruz and Kasich dropped out, some Republicans posted photos of themselves burning their voter registration cards or switching to independent, unaffiliated or Libertarian parties. Priebus on Twitter urged Republicans to “unite and focus on defeating (Hillary) Clinton.” Wasserman Shultz said the campaign has been “substantive” on the Democratic side but acknowledged it’s also gotten stickier as the primary season wears on. “They’re in the narrow end of the funnel right now, and so it’s been a bit more intense towards the end here,” she said. “The reality is that our voters are coming out of primaries saying that the primaries energized them and made them more enthusiastic about supporting either one of our candidates.” Hillary Clinton leads Bernie Sanders in delegates and is just a few hundred short of securing the presidential nomination in Philadelphia this summer, although the Sanders campaign hopes to persuade some superdelegates to switch sides. In California alone, of the state’s 73 superdelegates, more than 50 have already committed to Clinton. Sanders has suggested superdelegates who come from states he won should flip their votes to him. Wasserman Shultz said after the 2008 election “it’s a completely reasonable and fair process” and the 712 superdelegates are a small fraction of the 4,763 total delegates going to the convention in Philadelphia this summer. She also said superdelegates — in place since 1984 — have never determined the nominee. “We separate those 712 unpledged delegates and give them an opportunity to vote for who they want to because they are party leaders and elected officials and people who have been in the trenches to help build the party,” she said. -- Walter Garcia Western Regional Press Secretary Democratic National Committee (DNC) Email: GarciaW@dnc.org Twitter: @WalterGarcia231', 'Need to flag that we did nothing for Christmas or Easter but have done several Jewish ones.

Wasserman also said she believes Democrats can eventually turn Alaska blue, pointing to statistics that show the percentage of Alaskans casting their vote for the Democrat has increased in every presidential election since 2000. “Don’t believe for a second that just because the pundits like to paint Alaska red and say it isn’t a battleground state means you’re sidelined,” she said. “This has already been an exciting election year nationally.

Debbie Wasserman Schultz issued the following statement on Ted Cruz dropping out of the Republican primary and Donald Trump becoming the GOP’s presumptive nominee: “Tonight, Donald Trump is the Republican Party. Ted Cruz may have been the least-liked politician in Washington, but Trump is one of the least liked men in America, and Democrats will hold him accountable for his offensive rhetoric, dangerous ideas, and lack of judgment every single day between today and November 8th. “While Ted Cruz was known for obstruction, having forced a government shutdown that cost the U.S. economy $24 billion and even opposing emergency aid for a region hit by a devastating hurricane, he didn’t stand up to Donald Trump until it was too late. None of the Republicans running for president did, because after years of elevating extreme voices in their party, they didn’t want to alienate them. “The decades-old Republican strategy of exploiting unfounded fears of immigrants, minorities, the poor, the LGBT community and more, all for political gain, have laid the groundwork for Donald Trump. The Republican Party sold hardworking Americans the empty promise of trickle-down prosperity, while strangling America’s middle class with backwards economic policies that only enrich those already at the top. Donald Trump’s looming nomination will be the ultimate, sad culmination of the results of that strategy. “Democrats won’t hesitate to fight for the vast majority of the American people, who share our values of inclusion, hard work, dignity and opportunity for all, and we’ll hold Republicans on the ballot at every level accountable for their standard bearer. Voters will have a clear choice come November, and Americans of every stripe, including those disillusioned and disaffected by this year’s unprecedentedly nasty Republican primary have a home in the Democratic Party. Our voters are energized, enthusiastic, and optimistic because our candidates are committed to moving America forward. And that’s why we’re going to win on Election Day in November.” ###', \"Ok, I’m good with that. We’ll push it individually to reporters starting in 10 minutes unless we hear back otherwise.

So our work is never finished, and we must work together to confront this kind of hatred and call out those who would incite others to violence wherever and whenever they do. “The lessons of the Holocaust are especially important to remember this election season when the rhetoric of national politics will do doubt get heated, and our differences will be tested by those who wish to turn those differences into hard divisions.

We also celebrate the lives of those who survived, and the heroes who courageously fought the forces of ignorance, hatred, bigotry and brutality to end the Nazi regime and forge a brighter future for mankind. “Although the final days of the Holocaust are in our past, we must forever carry its lessons in our hearts and remain ever-vigilant not to repeat the same mistakes. Just last week, in my home state, the FBI thwarted a plot by a man who was trying to bomb the Aventura Turnberry Jewish Center. So our work is never finished, and we must work together to confront this kind of hatred and call out those who would incite others to violence wherever and whenever they do. “The lessons of the Holocaust are especially important to remember this election season when the rhetoric of national politics will do doubt get heated, and our differences will be tested by those who wish to turn those differences into hard divisions. But the Democratic Party stands for inclusion and diversity. And we will not stand for fear-mongering or the denigration of any group of people because of their faith, race or gender. We will continue to work to stop bigotry and hatred, and our nation will be stronger for it.” ###', '', \"From: Garcia, Walter Sent: Saturday, May 14, 2016 8:29 AM To: Miranda, Luis Cc: Jefferson, Deshundra; Wei, Shu-Yen; Palermo, Rachel Subject: Coverage of DWS in Alaska Starting chain. Riled Sanders fans rise up as state Democratic convention begins Alex DeMarban, Alaska Dispatch News Internal strife rocked the Alaska Democratic Party on Friday as it headed into its three-day state convention, with some members of the party that heavily favor Bernie Sanders over Hillary Clinton protesting the convention by planning an alternative event Saturday night. “Alaska voters are an independent people and they don’t want to be told what to do,” said Ed Cullinane, a member of the state central committee from an Anchorage House district. Cullinane helped organize the protest to the convention, where Democrats on Saturday will choose delegates to cast votes at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia in July. Though Clinton appears poised for victory in the hard-fought race, Sanders supporters say he can still claim a win though it would take a surge of delegates. The anti-convention event at the Egan Civic and Convention Center comes because Florida congresswoman and Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz plans to give the keynote speech at the convention in Anchorage Saturday, Cullinane said. Alaskan Democrats gave Sanders 81.6 percent of their support in the March caucus. Many believe Wasserman Schultz has limited debates and unfairly allocated resources to give Clinton a boost, he said. “A lot of us feel that Debbie Wasserman Schultz has displayed very unethical behavior,” he said. At the state convention on Friday afternoon at the UAA Student Union, during an opening day filled with discussions on matters such as Medicaid expansion and climate change, supporters of both Sanders and Clinton said it was important for Alaska Democrats to unite as the national convention approaches. “We all need to be respectful and find common ground,” said Shauna Thornton, a state delegate and “Bernie fan” who hopes to be selected as a national delegate from Alaska on Saturday. Thornton, who is running for a state House seat on the Kenai Peninsula, said she’s not angry Wasserman Schultz is speaking. “She was asked to come over a year ago, so what do you do? So I’ll attend and ask questions about her positions,” Thornton said. Cullinane also launched a petition at MoveOn.org asking the Alaska party to “un-invite” Wasserman Schultz. It had 64 signatures Friday afternoon. He said the anti-convention, which has no official name, will feature a teleconferenced appearance from Tim Canova, Schultz’ Democratic primary opponent in Florida. Plans also include a prerecorded presentation by Jane Sanders’ and a dunk tank with political activist Ray Metcalfe in the wet seat. The event will be held in Summit Hall at the Egan, starting at 6:30 p.m. Wasserman's speech is planned for 8 p.m. Saturday at the Dena'ina Civic and Convention Center. She's also scheduled to attend a reception there at 6 p.m. People need to put aside the “divisiveness” said Jennifer Smith, a state convention delegate from a Juneau district who supports Clinton because she’s “cool under fire” and well-versed on critical national issues. “If you want to have an alternative convention then fine, but if you really want to have change in the party structure you should directly address it to (Wasserman Schultz), and not do it through protests,” she said. Alaska Democratic Convention gets underway in Anchorage By Lauren Maxwell, KTVA Alaska At the State Democratic Convention in Anchorage, one of the big jobs party leaders have is to elect delegates to attend the national convention in July, when the presidential nominee will be decided. Back in March, candidate Bernie Sanders won the state’s Democratic caucus in a big way. All 16 of the state’s regular delegates who will go the national convention in Philadelphia are pledged to vote for him. But the state also has four super delegates who can vote for whomever they want. Casey Steinau is one of the super delegates. Steinau is the chairman of the Alaska Democratic Party, but as a super delegate, she’s undeclared. ”I am the chairman of the party and I believe that it is my job to represent 100 percent of the Alaska Democrats and I take that roll very seriously,” Steinau said. “I don’t think my personal preferences should be influencing anyone.” But the idea that super delegates can vote for whomever they want doesn’t sit well with many Democrats. “I think there probably will be a resolution or a platform change or something coming out of this convention which says we don’t necessarily agree with this and we would ask the DNC to reassess it,” Steinau said. Steinau said the resolution might ask to get rid of super delegates altogether or require them to vote for the person who won the state caucus. Meanwhile, Ddemocrats who support Hilary Clinton are also attending the convention. Carolyn Lee with the Hilary for Alaska campaign said there are a lot of people who like both candidates. “We are also getting a lot of Bernie supporters coming up and saying, ‘I’m going to be with Hilary in a couple of weeks but today I’m with Bernie,’” Lee said. Steinau said she was hopeful Alaska Democrats would support whichever candidate wins the Party’s nomination. “They both bring so much to the table and at the end of the day when that person is decided I know that we will come together as a united front.”\", \"Since you already went to Chuck I’ll wait for his response.

Debbie Wasserman Schultz issued the following statement on Ted Cruz dropping out of the Republican primary and Donald Trump becoming the GOP’s presumptive nominee: “Tonight, Donald Trump is the Republican Party. Ted Cruz may have been the least-liked politician in Washington, but Trump is one of the least liked men in America, and Democrats will hold him accountable for his offensive rhetoric, dangerous ideas, and lack of judgment every single day between today and November 8th. “While Ted Cruz was known for obstruction, having forced a government shutdown that cost the U.S. economy $24 billion and even opposing emergency aid for a region hit by a devastating hurricane, he didn’t stand up to Donald Trump until it was too late. None of the Republicans running for president did, because after years of elevating extreme voices in their party, they didn’t want to alienate them. “The decades-old Republican strategy of exploiting unfounded fears of immigrants, minorities, the poor, the LGBT community and more, all for political gain, have laid the groundwork for Donald Trump. The Republican Party sold hardworking Americans the empty promise of trickle-down prosperity, while strangling America’s middle class with backwards economic policies that only enrich those already at the top. Donald Trump’s looming nomination will be the ultimate, sad culmination of the results of that strategy. “Democrats won’t hesitate to fight for the vast majority of the American people, who share our values of inclusion, hard work, dignity and opportunity for all, and we’ll hold Republicans on the ballot at every level accountable for their standard bearer. Voters will have a clear choice come November, and Americans of every stripe, including those disillusioned and disaffected by this year’s unprecedentedly nasty Republican primary have a home in the Democratic Party. Our voters are energized, enthusiastic, and optimistic because our candidates are committed to moving America forward. And that’s why we’re going to win on Election Day in November.” ###', 'Nevada article has been fixed to at least not implicate the DNC the way it did before: From: Garcia, Walter Sent: Monday, May 16, 2016 1:00 PM To: Miranda, Luis Cc: Patrice Taylor; Paustenbach, Mark; Federico, Courtney; Dacey, Amy Subject: RE: Chaos At Nevada Democratic Convention; DNC Leaders Flee Building As Sanders Supporters Demand Recount | Video | RealClearPolitics Full updated article below.

Quote: “The suggestion there’s anything unusual about our joint victory funds has no basis in the law or reality. Independent experts like the Election Law Blog have noted that from a legal perspective, the criticisms are ‘weak,’ and both campaigns signed on to similar agreements. While only one campaign is currently using their joint victory fund, we encourage both of our campaigns to identify opportunities to support the national and state Democratic parties now so that we can continue to build the infrastructure to help elect Democrats up and down the ballot in November.” – DNC Communications Director On Background: · The money raised by the joint victory funds, even when the money goes to the DNC, still helps state parties. The funds help strengthen, for example, our national voter file and communications, research and digital support for state parties and down ballot candidates. That includes training across a variety of areas, for example, and access to media monitoring and rapid response support. This is helping the Party right NOW build the infrastructure we need for the general election. · Rick Hasen, an influential academic on campaign finance, posted an analysis on the Election Law Blog that addressed this issue. Hasen states in the article that “it is hard to see what provision of the law” is at issue. As the blog points out, “legally” the criticism of the fund “seems weak.” http://electionlawblog.org/?p=81996 · We welcome any effort by our candidates to help raise money for the DNC and state parties. · Similar agreements were set up with both the Clinton campaign and the Sanders campaign early in the cycle, precisely because of the urgency to build a strong national infrastructure now that will help elect Democrats up and down the ballot in November. The Sanders campaign has not used theirs. · These arrangements are not new or unusual. Similar joint fundraising committees were established with our Democratic candidate in both 2008 and 2012. And again, both campaigns have signed on and have the option of using joint victory funds. · And let’s be clear, neither the DNC nor state parties are subsidizing fundraising through these committees for either campaign. For whatever each campaign raises under the agreement that then goes to their campaign, that campaign pays a directly proportional amount for the cost of that fundraising. Luis Miranda, Communications Director Democratic National Committee 202-863-8148 – MirandaL@dnc.org - @MiraLuisDC', 'For Immediate Release 5 de Mayo del 2016 DNC Chair Statement in Honor of Cinco de Mayo Washington, D.C — DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz released the following statement today in honor of Cinco de Mayo: “Cinco de Mayo commemorates the Battle of Puebla in 1862, when a ragtag band of Mexican fighters and workers held back the French Army despite being both out-manned and out-gunned. More than 150 years later, the celebration of Cinco de Mayo represents more than the spirit of resilience and determination that carried that day. Cinco de Mayo is a date that speaks to the intrinsic and close ties between the United States and Mexico. “Cinco de Mayo celebrations were made popular in California, a reflection of the reality that Mexican-Americans have been a part of our history since before our nation’s founding. From the Mexican-Americans who gave rise to great cities like Los Angeles and San Antonio, to those who enrich our country every single day in education, medicine, engineering, sports, agriculture, and in our military, their role in the American landscape has made our country stronger. What Republicans don’t get, as they proved today by leaving out mentions of being a welcoming country in their Cinco de Mayo statement, is that Mexican-Americans are not only immigrants but rather a far larger share are Americans – some with families going back generations -- centuries -- within our borders. “So as we celebrate a day that reminds us of our shared history, cultural and familial ties, the Democratic Party reaffirms our commitment to exemplifying the values that made America great, and to continuing to fight every single day to ensure our country remains inclusive, while expanding opportunities for all.

KMEX -- UNIVISION LOS ANGELES WATCH HERE UNIVISION – UNIVISION LOS ANGELES WATCH HERE Media’s Trump Coverage ‘Needs to Be Balanced’ In General Election, Says DNC Chair VARIETY // TED JOHNSON Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz said that she expects that the “outrageously imbalanced” news media coverage of Donald Trump will “begin to even out” as the race heads to the general election. In an interview with Variety on Wednesday, Wasserman Schultz said that the general election will present a different dynamic because it will be a head-to-head matchup, versus the GOP primary when Trump dominated coverage against 16 other opponents. She said that the DNC “will be pushing for accountability when it comes to the media’s coverage of this campaign from our perspective. The opportunities should be essentially even, and so it is my hope and our expectation that the coverage would begin to even out, and you not allow what they allowed to play out during the primary. And I expect that they will be more responsible about it than they have.” Analytics firm MediaQuant valued Trump’s earned media coverage at $2.8 billion, compared to $1.2 billion for Hillary Clinton, $770.7 million for Ted Cruz and $658 million for Bernie Sanders. The figures are for 12 months ended April 30. The Trump coverage, she said, has “kind of been outrageously imbalanced.” Still, Wasserman Schultz said that it was “not for us to dictate” whether news networks conduct phone interviews with Trump, as opposed to in-studio or on camera interviews. Clinton has conducted phoners too, but news networks have been criticized for the extent to which they have featured Trump by audio only. “I am just talking about the coverage needs to be balanced, and they can’t just focus on ratings, and they need to focus on making sure that they present a fair opportunity that is presented to them without being mindful that there is a candidate on the other side,” she said. Wasserman Schultz was at the headquarters of the Los Angeles County Democratic Party, the day after Trump trounced Cruz in the Indiana primary and Cruz dropped out. Trump’s remaining rival, John Kasich, abandoned his bid on Wednesday, making Trump the presumptive nominee. Wasserman Schultz called Trump an “abomination.” “Donald Trump is the Republican party,” Wasserman Schultz said. “…So any comparison of Donald Trump being able to vanquish his opponents in the primary to he general election are really completely comparing apples and oranges. Donald Trump’s success has proven that this is where the Republican party of today is. They are right wing and extreme. They support misogyny. They are willing to support the most bigoted, sexist, misogynistic bully that has campaigned for the presidency in modern times. And that certainly is not where a majority of Americans are.” Still, she said that she agrees with pundits and analysts who say that Trump should not be underestimated. “We are a divided nation,” she said. “We are going to take this election very seriously, unlike Republicans, who laughed Donald Trump off for far too long. We have been assuming for many months that he would be their nominee, have been preparing for him to be their nominee, and we will be running this election as if it were a down-to-the-wire close election.” The race between Clinton and Sanders has gotten heated, while the expectation had been that the Democrats would wrap up their primary race before the Republicans did. Instead, Sanders won Indiana’s primary, although it didn’t put much of a dent in Clinton’s delegate lead. Wasserman Schultz said that she was “confident” of party unity. “On our side, compared to 2008, this is a relatively tame back and forth,” Wasserman Schultz said. “Go back and watch some of the acrimony between Obama and Clinton at this point. The election was much closer, and you had a lot more acrimony. Surrogates were on TV trashing the other. And not only did we reunify even though it played out through the primaries, President Obama eventually asked Senator Clinton to be his secretary of state.” Wasserman Schultz said that she has “cautioned the candidates at this stage of the campaign to be mindful of tone,” but she also noted that each candidate has vowed to support the other in the general election. Instead, she said that it is Republicans who “have a real problem with unity” based on sentiments expressed by some conservatives on social media who say they will never back Trump. She said that they would be reaching out to Republicans to support the Democratic nominee. “There are a number coming out publicly on their own,” she said. “We always do, but we see many more than usual on the Republican side who are actually saying they will not only go to the polls and vote for our candidate but will be willing to work for our candidate.” She predicted that there will be more voter interest in the Democratic National Convention than the Republican gathering, which she said is “going to be a circus.” “They are about to nominate the most extreme, racist, sexist, bigoted, misogynist in modern times,” she said. “So watching their convention play out will be more like watching a train wreck. You shouldn’t do it, but you can’t help yourself.” She added, “If you look comparatively at 2012, the Republican National Convention, with a so-called establishment nominee, ended with Clint Eastwood talking to an empty chair.” She said that this years DNC “will be such a clear and stark contrast about the choice that voters will have in being able to move us forward and focus on the future or be dragged backwards and worse.” Wasserman Schultz said that she expected the electoral map to look like it did in 2012, although she pointed to demographic shifts and expected turnout from voters alarmed at the prospect of Trump being elected. Although California is reliably blue, she pointed to 14,000 new Democrats registered in Orange County, a traditional conservative bastion. “They are generating interest on our side simply because of how badly [the Republicans] are alienating large groups of voters,” she said. Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders bring Democratic battle to California LA DAILY NEWS // DAVID MONTERO Welcome to what battleground state status feels like, California Democrats. At least for a little while. Just hours after Indiana sent Sen. Ted Cruz packing and Ohio Gov. John Kasich called it quits, essentially making Donald Trump the presumptive Republican nominee for president, the Democrats found they were the ones in the middle of the political drama, with their front-runner being chased by a challenger who not only won in the Hoosier State but has vowed to keep fighting through California’s June 7 primary. Bernie Sanders may be a mathematical long shot to get the Democratic presidential nomination, despite winning the Indiana primary Tuesday, but Hillary Clinton isn’t taking chances and has begun flooding California with rallies, office openings and fundraisers. The tussle between Clinton and Sanders for the state’s 475 delegates started in earnest today, as early primary voting gets underway Monday. Former President Bill Clinton spoke in Los Angeles on behalf of his wife at the Grand Suite Hotel on Wednesday before participating in a panel discussion about gun violence with members of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and actor Brad Pitt in the evening. His appearances in Southern California also included a speech in San Diego. The former president is also participating in a fundraiser this week and will deliver the commencement speech for undergraduates at Loyola Marymont University on Saturday. Meanwhile, Sanders had surrogates speaking for him at UC Irvine and Cal State Long Beach on Wednesday, a move that played to his popularity among college-age millennials. He went Hollywood with the move, tapping actors Kendrick Sampson of “How to Get Away With Murder,” Heather Matarazzo of “The Princess Diaries” and Oscar winner Susan Sarandon. Coming into Los Angeles on Wednesday to see the Golden State shuffle was Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who said she preferred her position of watching two of her party’s candidates duel for the nomination rather than the task facing her Republican counterpart, Reince Priebus. “I’ve never seen so much churn and angst and opposition to the presumptive nominee from a political party like what is taking place here,” she said in an interview at the Los Angeles County Democratic Party headquarters. “You know they have a massive problem on their hands.” When Cruz and Kasich dropped out, some Republicans posted photos of themselves burning their voter registration cards or switching to independent, unaffiliated or Libertarian parties. Priebus on Twitter urged Republicans to “unite and focus on defeating (Hillary) Clinton.” Wasserman Shultz said the campaign has been “substantive” on the Democratic side but acknowledged it’s also gotten stickier as the primary season wears on. “They’re in the narrow end of the funnel right now, and so it’s been a bit more intense towards the end here,” she said. “The reality is that our voters are coming out of primaries saying that the primaries energized them and made them more enthusiastic about supporting either one of our candidates.” Hillary Clinton leads Bernie Sanders in delegates and is just a few hundred short of securing the presidential nomination in Philadelphia this summer, although the Sanders campaign hopes to persuade some superdelegates to switch sides. In California alone, of the state’s 73 superdelegates, more than 50 have already committed to Clinton. Sanders has suggested superdelegates who come from states he won should flip their votes to him. Wasserman Shultz said after the 2008 election “it’s a completely reasonable and fair process” and the 712 superdelegates are a small fraction of the 4,763 total delegates going to the convention in Philadelphia this summer. She also said superdelegates — in place since 1984 — have never determined the nominee. “We separate those 712 unpledged delegates and give them an opportunity to vote for who they want to because they are party leaders and elected officials and people who have been in the trenches to help build the party,” she said. -- Walter Garcia Western Regional Press Secretary Democratic National Committee (DNC) Email: GarciaW@dnc.org Twitter: @WalterGarcia231', 'Not as a personal dig, but asking her to at a minimum pick up the phone and reach out. That her facts are wrong, and happy to talk her through it. For example, what I sent them included: The DNC Chair has repeatedly said on the air and otherwise that it’s not her job to tell either candidate to get out and has never called for anyone to get out of the race. She has talked in very positive terms about both of our candidates and the substantive campaigns they’ve run. As for the stuff that Joe and Mika tried to rehash this morning about debates, the fact is our debates earned far better ratings overall this year than they did in past cycles. And as NBC knows all too well, when we were able to get both campaigns to agree, we added four. The rules in place for this election have been pretty much the same for several cycles. In fact, the major change from 2008 – when Obama beat Clinton --- is that there are actually LESS unpledged “super” delegates, now down to 15% from 20% prior to the change. No one wrote or rewrote any rules to help or hurt any specific candidate, these are the Party rules. The single biggest factor determining the nominee (85%) is the participation of voters in primaries and caucuses. You can see a post we did here that lays out the facts on Super Delegates. It also debunks the false myths about Iowa. The DNC’s delegate selection rules for this primary were set before any of these candidates declared, and are consistent with the rules in place for several cycles – including 2008 when Barack Obama defeated Hillary Clinton. There’s just no evidence that the process has been rigged. It certainly wasn’t rigged in Nevada this weekend, which was not a DNC event but a state party one.

Bernie Sanders faces a ‘then what’ problem 05/19/16 08:53 AM—UPDATED 05/19/16 08:55 AM facebook twitter 1 save share group 93 By Steve Benen It’s safe to say May hasn’t gone quite as well as Bernie Sanders and his supporters had hoped. He needed landslide victories in several primaries, and he came up short. After steadily gaining on Hillary Clinton in national Democratic polls for months, the senator has seen his support slip in recent weeks. In Nevada, Sanders’ supporters caused a near-riot at the state Democratic convention, based on allegations of party wrongdoing that have struggled to withstand scrutiny. Sanders’ candidacy has had some highs and some lows, but all things considered, this hasn’t exactly been a month to remember. For his legions of supporters, it’s no doubt discouraging. The race for the Democratic nomination, however, still has about a month to go, and the New York Times reports that Team Sanders isn’t backing down, delegate arithmetic notwithstanding. Defiant and determined to transform the Democratic Party, Senator Bernie Sanders is opening a two-month phase of his presidential campaign aimed at inflicting a heavy blow on Hillary Clinton in California and amassing enough leverage to advance his agenda at the convention in July – or even wrest the nomination from her. It’s at this point when Sanders and campaign operation start to run into a “then what?” problem. According to the Times’ piece, for example, Team Sanders believes it may yet win the California primary, where polls show him trailing, which might have “a psychological impact” on Democrats. OK, but then what? If the idea is that Democratic insiders will ignore the will of the voters and the delegate count because of one primary result, awarding Sanders the nomination despite his second-place finish, there’s no reason to believe such a scenario is plausible. The same article said Team Sanders is willing to hurt Clinton, on purpose, even as the general-election phase gets underway. OK, but then what? There’s still no reason to believe this will prompt party officials to override the primary and caucus results. A Sanders supporter told the Times, “We want to have progressive values and socialism on the convention’s agenda.” OK, but then what? It’s not clear how, exactly, one puts “socialism” on the “agenda,” but even if that were possible, what happens afterwards? Tad Devine, a top Sanders strategist, told the Washington Post’s Greg Sargent yesterday that the Sanders campaign may ask for some changes among convention committee assignments. OK, but then what? What are the practical effects of changing which Democrats sit on which convention committees, and why should a second-place candidate dictate convention committees’ membership? There are rumors about Sanders supporters preparing for civil disobedience and organized disruptions at the Democratic convention itself. OK, but then what? History has shown that convention protests, even intra-party protests, can lead to meaningful change, but even if progressive activists literally started fires on the convention floor, in a display of violent catharsis, how does that bring Sanders and his allies any closer to their goals? The Times article added this key paragraph: [Sanders’] newly resolute attitude is also the cumulative result of months of anger at the national Democratic Party over a debate schedule that his campaign said favored Mrs. Clinton; a fund-raising arrangement between the party and the Clinton campaign; the appointment of fierce Clinton partisans as leaders of important convention committees; and the party’s rebuke of Mr. Sanders on Tuesday for not clearly condemning a melee at the Nevada Democratic convention on Saturday. It’s worth noting, however, that the national Democratic Party agreed to expand the debate schedule, and it offered Sanders literally the identical fundraising arrangement it struck with the Clinton campaign. Democratic officials also worked to make sure Sanders appeared on the New Hampshire and D.C. primary ballots, even after procedural and legal questions arose surrounding his eligibility – steps the DNC wouldn’t have taken if it were trying to rig the process against him. There’s still time to avoid scenarios that could prove costly in the fall, but not a lot of time. Sanders believes, accurately, that he has some leverage: if he’s not satisfied with how the process unfolds in the coming weeks, the senator can sabotage the party’s ticket and elect President Trump. What’s less clear is what he’ll demand in exchange for his supp', 'FYI From: Bennett, Eric Sent: Tuesday, May 03, 2016 8:26 PM To: Comm_D Subject: Cruz dropping out!!!

Clearly the GOP’s problems go well beyond their convention. “In just seven days, Republicans saw their former House Speaker call one of their candidates ‘Lucifer in the flesh,’ watched a desperate, mathematically-eliminated campaign announce a Vice Presidential pick and get ridiculed for it, and then kicked off the Indiana primaries this morning with accusations that Ted Cruz’s father was tied to Lee Harvey Oswald. The absurdity of that last allegation was compounded by the fact that Dangerous Donald Trump, who is just a hair’s-breadth away from securing the Republican nomination, based it on a tabloid story he saw in the National Enquirer. “No wonder the Republican Party is less popular than it’s been in more than two decades. Just today, exit polls in Indiana showed that 53 percent of Indiana primary Republican voters say they feel betrayed by the Republican Party. And in recent weeks, exit polls in primary after primary have shown that a majority of Republican voters believe their primary has been divisive, with as much as a third preferring to either stay home or vote for an alternative, rather than voting for their eventual nominee. “Meanwhile, Democratic voters are proud of their candidates and it shows each time they go to the polls. Last week, in Connecticut and Pennsylvania respectively, 67% and 71% of Democrats reported feeling energized by our primary. Today in Indiana it was three-quarters of Democratic voters who said our primary has energized our party, and a majority of Democrats who voted today expressed support for either one of our candidates. “Today it’s clearer than ever that none of the Republican candidates has the judgment or temperament to serve as our Commander in Chief.

Bernie Sanders’ campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, on Monday criticized a Hillary Clinton campaign fundraising scheme that state party leaders told Politico has been used as a self-serving “money-laundering\" conduit. Despite Clinton’s pledges to rebuild state parties, Politico found that less than 1 percent of the $61 million raised by the Victory Fund has stayed in the state parties’ coffers. “Secretary Clinton is looting funds meant for the state parties to skirt fundraising limits on her presidential campaign,” Weaver said. “We think the Clinton campaign should let the state parties keep their fair share of the cash.” Sanders’ and Clinton’s primary campaigns both raised about $26 million in April, but Politico documented how the Hillary Victory Fund, a supposedly joint fundraising committee, has been exploited to inflate her presidential primary campaign. “Secretary Clinton has exploited the rules in ways that let her high-dollar donors like Alice Walton of Wal-Mart fame and the actor George Clooney and his super-rich Hollywood friends skirt legal limits on campaign contributions,” Weaver added. “If Secretary Clinton can\\'t raise the funds needed to run in a competitive primary without resorting to laundering, how will she compete against Donald Trump in a general election?” The Sanders campaign first raised questions about the arrangement in an April 18 letter from Brad Deutsch, the attorney for Sanders’ campaign, to U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the chair of the DNC. \"Hillary Clinton says that campaign finance reform is one of the most important issues facing our country but her campaign\\'s use of the Victory Fund to essentially launder money proves otherwise,\" Weaver said. \"You cannot exploit a broken campaign finance system one day and vow to get big money out of politics the next.\" Sanders last month raised money for three progressive Democratic candidates for the House of Representatives. Unlike the Hillary Victory Fund, every dollar went directly to helping the candidates. The senator has also raised significant sums for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. ### Paid for by Bernie 2016 PO Box 905 - Burlington, Vermont 05402, United States', \"Madam Chair, we have new guidance on how to discuss the map going forward.

Given the results in 2012, this would mean Trump would have to make major inroads into states that President Obama won in both 2008 and 2012 to win. · Since the last election, demographic changes have made states like Florida and North Carolina even more competitive for Democrats. · When it comes to partisanship, we're a fairly evenly divided country, but this is likely the first time in a generation where we may have a better opportunity to appeal to more Republicans. · Biggest threat to Democrats holding the White House is complacency.

Clearly the GOP’s problems go well beyond their convention. “In just seven days, Republicans saw their former House Speaker call one of their candidates ‘Lucifer in the flesh,’ watched a desperate, mathematically-eliminated campaign announce a Vice Presidential pick and get ridiculed for it, and then kicked off the Indiana primaries this morning with accusations that Ted Cruz’s father was tied to Lee Harvey Oswald. The absurdity of that last allegation was compounded by the fact that Dangerous Donald Trump, who is just a hair’s-breadth away from securing the Republican nomination, based it on a tabloid story he saw in the National Enquirer. “No wonder the Republican Party is less popular than it’s been in more than two decades. Just today, exit polls in Indiana showed that 53 percent of Indiana primary Republican voters say they feel betrayed by the Republican Party. And in recent weeks, exit polls in primary after primary have shown that a majority of Republican voters believe their primary has been divisive, with as much as a third preferring to either stay home or vote for an alternative, rather than voting for their eventual nominee. “Meanwhile, Democratic voters are proud of their candidates and it shows each time they go to the polls. Last week, in Connecticut and Pennsylvania respectively, 67% and 71% of Democrats reported feeling energized by our primary. Today in Indiana it was three-quarters of Democratic voters who said our primary has energized our party, and a majority of Democrats who voted today expressed support for either one of our candidates. “Today it’s clearer than ever that none of the Republican candidates has the judgment or temperament to serve as our Commander in Chief.

Bernie Sanders faces a ‘then what’ problem 05/19/16 08:53 AM—UPDATED 05/19/16 08:55 AM facebook twitter 1 save share group 93 By Steve Benen It’s safe to say May hasn’t gone quite as well as Bernie Sanders and his supporters had hoped. He needed landslide victories in several primaries, and he came up short. After steadily gaining on Hillary Clinton in national Democratic polls for months, the senator has seen his support slip in recent weeks. In Nevada, Sanders’ supporters caused a near-riot at the state Democratic convention, based on allegations of party wrongdoing that have struggled to withstand scrutiny. Sanders’ candidacy has had some highs and some lows, but all things considered, this hasn’t exactly been a month to remember. For his legions of supporters, it’s no doubt discouraging. The race for the Democratic nomination, however, still has about a month to go, and the New York Times reports that Team Sanders isn’t backing down, delegate arithmetic notwithstanding. Defiant and determined to transform the Democratic Party, Senator Bernie Sanders is opening a two-month phase of his presidential campaign aimed at inflicting a heavy blow on Hillary Clinton in California and amassing enough leverage to advance his agenda at the convention in July – or even wrest the nomination from her. It’s at this point when Sanders and campaign operation start to run into a “then what?” problem. According to the Times’ piece, for example, Team Sanders believes it may yet win the California primary, where polls show him trailing, which might have “a psychological impact” on Democrats. OK, but then what? If the idea is that Democratic insiders will ignore the will of the voters and the delegate count because of one primary result, awarding Sanders the nomination despite his second-place finish, there’s no reason to believe such a scenario is plausible. The same article said Team Sanders is willing to hurt Clinton, on purpose, even as the general-election phase gets underway. OK, but then what? There’s still no reason to believe this will prompt party officials to override the primary and caucus results. A Sanders supporter told the Times, “We want to have progressive values and socialism on the convention’s agenda.” OK, but then what? It’s not clear how, exactly, one puts “socialism” on the “agenda,” but even if that were possible, what happens afterwards? Tad Devine, a top Sanders strategist, told the Washington Post’s Greg Sargent yesterday that the Sanders campaign may ask for some changes among convention committee assignments. OK, but then what? What are the practical effects of changing which Democrats sit on which convention committees, and why should a second-place candidate dictate convention committees’ membership? There are rumors about Sanders supporters preparing for civil disobedience and organized disruptions at the Democratic convention itself. OK, but then what? History has shown that convention protests, even intra-party protests, can lead to meaningful change, but even if progressive activists literally started fires on the convention floor, in a display of violent catharsis, how does that bring Sanders and his allies any closer to their goals? The Times article added this key paragraph: [Sanders’] newly resolute attitude is also the cumulative result of months of anger at the national Democratic Party over a debate schedule that his campaign said favored Mrs. Clinton; a fund-raising arrangement between the party and the Clinton campaign; the appointment of fierce Clinton partisans as leaders of important convention committees; and the party’s rebuke of Mr. Sanders on Tuesday for not clearly condemning a melee at the Nevada Democratic convention on Saturday. It’s worth noting, however, that the national Democratic Party agreed to expand the debate schedule, and it offered Sanders literally the identical fundraising arrangement it struck with the Clinton campaign. Democratic officials also worked to make sure Sanders appeared on the New Hampshire and D.C. primary ballots, even after procedural and legal questions arose surrounding his eligibility – steps the DNC wouldn’t have taken if it were trying to rig the process against him. There’s still time to avoid scenarios that could prove costly in the fall, but not a lot of time. Sanders believes, accurately, that he has some leverage: if he’s not satisfied with how the process unfolds in the coming weeks, the senator can sabotage the party’s ticket and elect President Trump.

In a letter to the chairwoman, the Sanders noted that of the 45 names he submitted Democratic National Convention committees, Wasserman Schultz appointed only three. \"I believe the composition of the standing committees must reflect the relative support that has been received by both campaigns,\" Sanders wrote in the letter dated May 6. \"That was why I was so disappointed to learn that of the over forty people our campaign submitted at your request you chose to select only three of my recommendations for the three standing committees. Moreover, you did not assign even on of the people submitted by our campaign to the very important Rules Committee of the Democratic National Convention.\" Sanders said that if the disagreement over convention committee appointments is not resolved, he would have his delegates move to change the platform on the floor of the convention. \"It is my hope we can quickly resolve this in a fair way,\" Sanders wrote. \"If the process is set up to produce an unfair, one-sided result, we are prepared to mobilize our delegates to force as many votes as necessary to amend the platform and rules of the floor convention.\" Sanders\\' chances of taking the Democratic nomination have grown, as he has a deep disadvantage in both pledged and superdelegates. But the insurgent candidate has vowed to continue on, and his deep run into the primary gives him additional leverage to pull the party to the left. In his letter, Sanders also mentioned the Democratic Party platform drafting committee. In the letter he recounted Wasserman Schultz had discussed changing the process for selecting members of the committee. \"In our conversation, you told me with respect to the platform Drafting Committee that you would consider allowing each campaign to submit ten names from which you would choose four from each and then you would add an additional seven,\" Sanders continued. \"While having four members on the Drafting Committee is an improvement, it does not address the fact that up to this point Bernie 2016 has secured 45% of the pledged delegates awarded.

Box 905 • Burlington, Vermont 05402 • 802-862-1505 • www.berniesanders.com May 6, 2016 Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz Democratic National Committee 430 South Capitol Street Southeast Washington, DC 20003 Dear Chairwoman Wasserman Schultz: I am writing to follow up on our discussion about the composition of the standing committees of the Democratic National Convention. In order to reflect the views and aspirations of the millions who support both my candidacy and Secretary Clinton’s, I believe that the composition of the standing committees must reflect the relative support that has been received by both campaigns. That was why I was so disappointed to learn that of the over forty people our campaign submitted at your request you chose to select only three of my recommendations for the three standing committees. Moreover, you did not assign even one of the people submitted by our campaign to the very important Rules Committee of the Democratic National Convention. If we are to have a unified party in the fall, no matter who wins the nomination, we cannot have a Democratic National Convention in which the views of millions of people who participated in the Democratic nominating process are unrepresented in the committee membership appointed by you, the Chair. That sends the very real message that the Democratic Party is not open to the millions of new people that our campaign has brought into the political process, does not want to hear new voices, and is unwilling to respect the broader base of people that this party needs to win over in November and beyond. Fairness, inclusion and transparency should be the standard under which we operate. In our conversation, you told me with respect to the platform drafting Committee that you would consider allowing each campaign to submit ten names from which you would choose four from each and then you would add an additional seven. While having four members on the Drafting Committee is an improvement, it does not address the fact that up to this point Bernie 2016 has secured some 45% of the pledged delegates awarded. Frankly, we believe that percentage will go up in the coming weeks and, of course, we hope it will end up being a majority. I believe that each campaign should chose seven members to serve on the Drafting Committee. The fifteenth member would be a chair who would be jointly picked by the two campaigns. This process will ensure that all the standing committees reflect the full range of views of voters who have participated in the Democratic nominating contests. This process will also ensure that the chairs of the standing committees conduct their proceedings with fairness and transparency. As it stands now, the chairs of the Rules Committee and the Platform Committee are active supporters of Secretary Clinton’s campaign. But even more than that, they both are aggressive attack surrogates on the campaign trail. I do not, and the millions who have supported our campaign will not, have any confidence that either of them will conduct committee proceeding in an even-handed manner. In fact, the suggestion that they would be appropriate chairs in and of itself suggests the standing committees are being established in an overtly partisan way meant to exclude the input of the voters who have supported my candidacy. As you know, there are already over 9 million voters who, during this nominating process, have indicated that they want to go beyond establishment politics and establishment economics - and want to transform our country with bold initiatives. I will not allow them be silenced at the Democratic National Convention. It is my hope we can quickly resolve this in a fair way. If the process is set up to produce an unfair, one-sided result, we are prepared to mobilize our delegates to force as many votes as necessary to amend the platform and rules on the floor of the convention. Thank you in advance for your help in establishing standing committees that are fair and inclusive. I look forward to hearing from you.

Bernie Sanders — seats on a key convention platform committee — but it may not be enough to stop Sanders from picking a fight over the party’s policy positions. Allies of both Clinton and Sanders have urged Democratic leaders to meet some of Sanders’s more mundane demands for greater inclusion at the Philadelphia convention. Their decision to do so is expected to be finalized by the end of the week, according to two people familiar with the discussions. But growing mistrust between Sanders supporters and party leaders have threatened to undermine that effort. Even with the committee assignments, Sanders plans an aggressive effort to extract platform concessions on key policies that could prompt divisive battles at a moment when front-runner Hillary Clinton will be trying to unify the party. Among other issues, he plans to push for a $15 national minimum wage and argue that the party needs a more balanced position regarding Israel and Palestinians, according to a Sanders campaign aide who requested anonymity to speak candidly. Much like their view that the economy has been “rigged” to benefit the wealthy more than the middle and working classes, Sanders supporters have become increasingly convinced that national Democrats have stacked the political deck with rules that have made it difficult for Sanders to win enough delegates to threaten Clinton’s nomination. Party leaders, meanwhile, have grown more frustrated with Sanders, who they say has unfairly fueled that perception. “I don’t think they’ve handled it very well and I think they’ve lost the moral high ground on this,” said Ken Martin, chairman of Minnesota’s Democratic-Farmer Labor Party. “It’s very clear now that the longer they stay in this race the more damage they’re doing.” The mistrust hit a boiling point in Nevada over the weekend, when a ruckus caused by Sanders supporters prompted security officials to cut short the state party convention. The incident worried party leaders impatient with the prolonged Democratic primary and looking to avoid drama in Philadelphia. Their impatience spread to Sanders when he issued a defiant statementaccusing Nevada Democrats of preventing a “fair and transparent process.” Separately, the composition of three convention committees — platform, rules and credentials — has become key. Earlier this month, in a letter to DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Sanders threatened to bring the fight to the floor of the convention if she did not appoint more of his loyalists to the each of the three committees. Martin and other Democratic chairmen urged national leaders to give Sanders the concessions he seeks — especially when it comes to the platform, which in the long run does not have a material impact on Democrats’ electoral chances in November. “There are other chairs who probably feel that way and feel like this is my party and f--- Bernie Sanders,” said Martin, a Clinton supporter. “I’m not one of those. “I feel very passionately that we have to open up that party and make sure that those voices are heard,” he said. One of Sanders’s demands was the composition of the 15-person drafting committee, whose members are appointed at Wasserman Schultz’s discretion and write the party’s platform. Play Video1 One Democratic Party official requesting anonymity said Wasserman Schultz asked for recommendations from both campaigns in an effort to be inclusive. But Sanders had sought to split the committee evenly between his and Clinton’s allies — plus one “neutral” appointment from Wasserman Schultz. Weeks of negotiations followed, and the DNC eventually agreed to add more Sanders representatives. According to two people familiar with the conversations, the DNC and the campaigns will reach a final agreement — probably less than Sanders wanted but more than the DNC originally offered — by the end of the week. A spokesman for the DNC declined to comment on the negotiations. Sanders’s aides have also publicly and privately complained about the appointment of two Clinton loyalists — former congressman Barney Frank of Massachusetts to head the Rules Committee and Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy to lead the Platform Committee — as chairmen of two of the convention’s standing bodies. Tad Devine, a senior adviser to the Sanders campaign, said this week that they may yet seek to have Frank and Malloy removed from their posts. In an interview with CNN Thursday, Clinton noted pointedly that she believes Sanders no longer has a shot at the nomination. She also said that Sanders will need to encourage his supporters to unify behind her, just as she did in 2008 when running against Barack Obama. “I have every confidence that we’re going to be unified,” Clinton said. “I think what brings us together is Donald Trump.” That hasn’t happened yet. A Sanders spokesman disputed Clinton’s assertion that the nomination is hers. And Sanders has ramped up the rhetoric in recent days, saying after Clinton won Kentucky that he still intends to win the nomination despite an overwhelming disadvantage in delegates. Even if he doesn’t, he still intends to pick a platform fight at the convention, according to a campaign aide who requested anonymity to discuss strategy. Clinton aides have said that on a slew of issues, Sanders is not far from the party. But the issue of U.S. policy toward Israel — which a Sanders adviser said “absolutely, legitimately will be a point of conversation” — has made some of Clinton’s backers nervous. Sanders is seeking a more “even-handed” U.S. approach to Israeli occupation of land Palestinians claim for a future state. The current platform does not address the nearly five-decade occupation directly, but it endorses “a just and lasting Israeli-Palestinian accord, producing two states for two peoples.” Speaking last month during a contentious debate with Clinton, Sanders — who declared himself “100 percent pro-Israel” — said that Israel’s 2014 military assault on the Gaza Strip was “disproportionate” to the threat posed by Hamas rockets launched from the Palestinian territory into Israel. Behind his words is a long debate among U.S. and international policymakers — one that divides the Democratic base and could pose a challenge for Clinton when she must bring her party together: how to weigh Palestinian interests when dealing with Israel, and whether resolute U.S. backing for Israel diminishes leverage to promote peace and fair treatment of Palestinians. “On one hand there is not an enormous amount of difference between them. They are both pro-Israel, they are both pro-peace,” said one longtime Clinton supporter. “But in the context of the campaign terms like ‘even-handed’ can come to mean that the United States is signaling a shift” — and Clinton would oppose that.\", 'Great.

That her facts are wrong, and happy to talk her through it. For example, what I sent them included: The DNC Chair has repeatedly said on the air and otherwise that it’s not her job to tell either candidate to get out and has never called for anyone to get out of the race. She has talked in very positive terms about both of our candidates and the substantive campaigns they’ve run. As for the stuff that Joe and Mika tried to rehash this morning about debates, the fact is our debates earned far better ratings overall this year than they did in past cycles. And as NBC knows all too well, when we were able to get both campaigns to agree, we added four. The rules in place for this election have been pretty much the same for several cycles. In fact, the major change from 2008 – when Obama beat Clinton --- is that there are actually LESS unpledged “super” delegates, now down to 15% from 20% prior to the change. No one wrote or rewrote any rules to help or hurt any specific candidate, these are the Party rules. The single biggest factor determining the nominee (85%) is the participation of voters in primaries and caucuses. You can see a post we did here that lays out the facts on Super Delegates. It also debunks the false myths about Iowa. The DNC’s delegate selection rules for this primary were set before any of these candidates declared, and are consistent with the rules in place for several cycles – including 2008 when Barack Obama defeated Hillary Clinton.

Bernie Sanders faces a ‘then what’ problem 05/19/16 08:53 AM—UPDATED 05/19/16 08:55 AM facebook twitter 1 save share group 93 By Steve Benen It’s safe to say May hasn’t gone quite as well as Bernie Sanders and his supporters had hoped. He needed landslide victories in several primaries, and he came up short. After steadily gaining on Hillary Clinton in national Democratic polls for months, the senator has seen his support slip in recent weeks. In Nevada, Sanders’ supporters caused a near-riot at the state Democratic convention, based on allegations of party wrongdoing that have struggled to withstand scrutiny. Sanders’ candidacy has had some highs and some lows, but all things considered, this hasn’t exactly been a month to remember. For his legions of supporters, it’s no doubt discouraging. The race for the Democratic nomination, however, still has about a month to go, and the New York Times reports that Team Sanders isn’t backing down, delegate arithmetic notwithstanding. Defiant and determined to transform the Democratic Party, Senator Bernie Sanders is opening a two-month phase of his presidential campaign aimed at inflicting a heavy blow on Hillary Clinton in California and amassing enough leverage to advance his agenda at the convention in July – or even wrest the nomination from her. It’s at this point when Sanders and campaign operation start to run into a “then what?” problem. According to the Times’ piece, for example, Team Sanders believes it may yet win the California primary, where polls show him trailing, which might have “a psychological impact” on Democrats. OK, but then what? If the idea is that Democratic insiders will ignore the will of the voters and the delegate count because of one primary result, awarding Sanders the nomination despite his second-place finish, there’s no reason to believe such a scenario is plausible. The same article said Team Sanders is willing to hurt Clinton, on purpose, even as the general-election phase gets underway. OK, but then what? There’s still no reason to believe this will prompt party officials to override the primary and caucus results. A Sanders supporter told the Times, “We want to have progressive values and socialism on the convention’s agenda.” OK, but then what? It’s not clear how, exactly, one puts “socialism” on the “agenda,” but even if that were possible, what happens afterwards? Tad Devine, a top Sanders strategist, told the Washington Post’s Greg Sargent yesterday that the Sanders campaign may ask for some changes among convention committee assignments. OK, but then what? What are the practical effects of changing which Democrats sit on which convention committees, and why should a second-place candidate dictate convention committees’ membership? There are rumors about Sanders supporters preparing for civil disobedience and organized disruptions at the Democratic convention itself. OK, but then what? History has shown that convention protests, even intra-party protests, can lead to meaningful change, but even if progressive activists literally started fires on the convention floor, in a display of violent catharsis, how does that bring Sanders and his allies any closer to their goals? The Times article added this key paragraph: [Sanders’] newly resolute attitude is also the cumulative result of months of anger at the national Democratic Party over a debate schedule that his campaign said favored Mrs. Clinton; a fund-raising arrangement between the party and the Clinton campaign; the appointment of fierce Clinton partisans as leaders of important convention committees; and the party’s rebuke of Mr. Sanders on Tuesday for not clearly condemning a melee at the Nevada Democratic convention on Saturday. It’s worth noting, however, that the national Democratic Party agreed to expand the debate schedule, and it offered Sanders literally the identical fundraising arrangement it struck with the Clinton campaign. Democratic officials also worked to make sure Sanders appeared on the New Hampshire and D.C. primary ballots, even after procedural and legal questions arose surrounding his eligibility – steps the DNC wouldn’t have taken if it were trying to rig the process against him. There’s still time to avoid scenarios that could prove costly in the fall, but not a lot of time. Sanders believes, accurately, that he has some leverage: if he’s not satisfied with how the process unfolds in the coming weeks, the senator can sabotage the party’s ticket and elect President Trump. What’s less clear is what he’ll demand in exchange for his supp', 'Ok, the AP has this: Because the Party’s platform is a statement of our values, the DNC is committed to an open, inclusive and representative process. Both of our campaigns will be represented on the Drafting Committee, and just as we did in 2008 and 2012, the public will have opportunities to participate.

In order to reflect the views and aspirations of the millions who support both my candidacy and Secretary Clinton’s, I believe that the composition of the standing committees must reflect the relative support that has been received by both campaigns. That was why I was so disappointed to learn that of the over forty people our campaign submitted at your request you chose to select only three of my recommendations for the three standing committees. Moreover, you did not assign even one of the people submitted by our campaign to the very important Rules Committee of the Democratic National Convention. If we are to have a unified party in the fall, no matter who wins the nomination, we cannot have a Democratic National Convention in which the views of millions of people who participated in the Democratic nominating process are unrepresented in the committee membership appointed by you, the Chair. That sends the very real message that the Democratic Party is not open to the millions of new people that our campaign has brought into the political process, does not want to hear new voices, and is unwilling to respect the broader base of people that this party needs to win over in November and beyond. Fairness, inclusion and transparency should be the standard under which we operate. In our conversation, you told me with respect to the platform drafting Committee that you would consider allowing each campaign to submit ten names from which you would choose four from each and then you would add an additional seven. While having four members on the Drafting Committee is an improvement, it does not address the fact that up to this point Bernie 2016 has secured some 45% of the pledged delegates awarded. Frankly, we believe that percentage will go up in the coming weeks and, of course, we hope it will end up being a majority. I believe that each campaign should chose seven members to serve on the Drafting Committee. The fifteenth member would be a chair who would be jointly picked by the two campaigns. This process will ensure that all the standing committees reflect the full range of views of voters who have participated in the Democratic nominating contests. This process will also ensure that the chairs of the standing committees conduct their proceedings with fairness and transparency. As it stands now, the chairs of the Rules Committee and the Platform Committee are active supporters of Secretary Clinton’s campaign. But even more than that, they both are aggressive attack surrogates on the campaign trail. I do not, and the millions who have supported our campaign will not, have any confidence that either of them will conduct committee proceeding in an even-handed manner. In fact, the suggestion that they would be appropriate chairs in and of itself suggests the standing committees are being established in an overtly partisan way meant to exclude the input of the voters who have supported my candidacy. As you know, there are already over 9 million voters who, during this nominating process, have indicated that they want to go beyond establishment politics and establishment economics - and want to transform our country with bold initiatives. I will not allow them be silenced at the Democratic National Convention. It is my hope we can quickly resolve this in a fair way. If the process is set up to produce an unfair, one-sided result, we are prepared to mobilize our delegates to force as many votes as necessary to amend the platform and rules on the floor of the convention.

Luis Miranda, Communications Director Democratic National Committee 202-863-8148 – MirandaL@dnc.org - @MiraLuisDC', 'For Immediate Release 5 de Mayo del 2016 DNC Chair Statement in Honor of Cinco de Mayo Washington, D.C — DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz released the following statement today in honor of Cinco de Mayo: “Cinco de Mayo commemorates the Battle of Puebla in 1862, when a ragtag band of Mexican fighters and workers held back the French Army despite being both out-manned and out-gunned. More than 150 years later, the celebration of Cinco de Mayo represents more than the spirit of resilience and determination that carried that day. Cinco de Mayo is a date that speaks to the intrinsic and close ties between the United States and Mexico. “Cinco de Mayo celebrations were made popular in California, a reflection of the reality that Mexican-Americans have been a part of our history since before our nation’s founding. From the Mexican-Americans who gave rise to great cities like Los Angeles and San Antonio, to those who enrich our country every single day in education, medicine, engineering, sports, agriculture, and in our military, their role in the American landscape has made our country stronger. What Republicans don’t get, as they proved today by leaving out mentions of being a welcoming country in their Cinco de Mayo statement, is that Mexican-Americans are not only immigrants but rather a far larger share are Americans – some with families going back generations -- centuries -- within our borders. “So as we celebrate a day that reminds us of our shared history, cultural and familial ties, the Democratic Party reaffirms our commitment to exemplifying the values that made America great, and to continuing to fight every single day to ensure our country remains inclusive, while expanding opportunities for all. We celebrate our diversity, and we’re proud that our Party and our convention will reflect that. “That Donald Trump became his Party’s presumptive nominee on the eve of Cinco de Mayo is fitting, a reminder of just how wrong his divisive and hateful rhetoric has been since the very first day of his campaign. Today is a reminder that Dangerous Donald would threaten America’s relationships with our closest allies, and make our communities less safe. Like the brave souls that day in Puebla a century and a half ago, we must show the spirit and determination every single day between now and November 8th to defeat Trump and his Republican Party in November, and ensure our country continues to live up to our history and our values.” ###', \"Points to consider: · Reince did a full Ginsburg at his lowest point. That’s what draws attention. · We cancel on them now and things get all nice they, may not want us back till convention if at all. · We can’t be offended about any topic or question, it’s our job to be accountable, and it looks better if we answer and pivot, than just not show up at all. · The coverage has shifted significantly, it’s much better today (see NYT story and WaPo editorial). It’s clear that Bernie messed up and we were on the right side of history. We’re going to take hits, but Bernie defending the actions the way he’s done I think makes him look bad more than us. · Clinton campaign is a mess, they’re afraid of their own shadow and didn’t like that we engaged. I happen to think they’re wrong and it explains why they’re hobbling along unable to close it out. But they’ll be unhappy regardless, so better to get out there and do some strong pivots and land good punches on Trump. They can’t tell us NOT to do TV right now, we shouldn’t pull ourselves out until they actually do. · We just have to stress this isn’t DNC vs Bernie/Weaver, this is about the principle of non violence and we’re glad the Sanders camp finally separated that out.

In its statement on Friday announcing the withdrawal, Sanders\\' campaign also strongly maintained that it never deliberately stole information. Story Continued Below \"The Sanders campaign never \\'stole\\' any voter file data; the Sanders campaign never \\'exported\\' any unauthorized voter file data; and the Sanders campaign certainly never had access to the Clinton campaign\\'s \\'strategic road map,\\' the Sanders campaign said. The campaign initially filed the lawsuit in December after a controversy late last year in which Sanders staffers improperly accessed information from Hillary Clinton\\'s data file after a firewall between the campaigns\\' information was inadvertently dropped. The DNC quickly punished Sanders by cutting off his campaign\\'s access to its own voter file information. The move incensed Sanders\\' camp, which accused the DNC of flagrantly favoring Clinton. Sanders sued for negligence and breach of contract. His campaign sought $75,000 in damages from the DNC for temporarily freezing the data access. The Sanders campaign statement on Friday went on to say that an independent investigation vindicated the campaign in the matter. \"With the investigation behind us, the campaign has withdrawn its lawsuit against the DNC today but continues to implore the DNC to address the systemic instability that remains in its voter file system,\" the statement said. \"It is imperative that the DNC make it a top priority to prevent future data security failures in the voter file system, failures that only serve as unnecessary distractions to the democratic process.\" But in a separate statement, the DNC said that the independent investigation by CrowdStrike agreed upon by the Sanders campaign and the DNC \"identified evidence of unauthorized access via four user accounts from the Bernie 2016 campaign. All unauthorized access occurred during a one-hour period from 10:41 to 11:42 EST on December 16, 2015.\" \"During that time, the four users conducted 25 searches using proprietary Hillary for America score data across 11 states. All of the results of these searches were saved within the VoteBuilder system, with the exception of one instance where a user exported a statistical summary of a search using HFA scoring in New Hampshire,\" the DNC statement said. \"CrowdStrike found no evidence of unauthorized access by the Hillary for America or O’Malley for President campaigns. Today, the Sanders campaign also voluntarily dismissed the breach of contract action pending against the DNC.\" Read more: http://www.politico.com/story/2016/04/bernie-sanders-dnc-lawsuit-campaign-222659#ixzz47Fe3StwE', 'Well to that I say \"lolz!\"', 'State party defended better today: From: Garcia, Walter Sent: Saturday, May 14, 2016 6:33 PM To: Miranda, Luis Cc: Jefferson, Deshundra; Wei, Shu-Yen; Palermo, Rachel Subject: Re: Coverage of DWS in Alaska Hundreds of Democrats Converge in Anchorage for State Democratic Party Convention ANCHORAGE (KTUU) Hundreds of Alaska democrats are converging in Anchorage this weekend for the state party convention to decide who will represent the state at the national convention in July. The first day of the weekend-long event kicked off Friday at UAA Student Union. The convention follows the democratic caucus where Bernie Sanders won 81 percent of the vote in the March. Hillary Clinton captured 21 percent of delegates. Jake Hamburg, communications director for Alaska Democratic Party, said among party business items delegates will discuss possible changes to the caucus process. \"We saw some people wanting to participate, but just couldn\\'t access a caucus location so we\\'re exploring some ideas of doing remote caucus participation, or absentee process or maybe even going to a presidential preference poll,\" Hamburg said. Greg Smith, a delegate from Juneau said there\\'s always room for improvement. \"I think there is a group of people that feel like the process, the nomination process maybe isn\\'t fully open, fully fair,\" Smith said. \"You have to be a registered democrat to participate in that caucus, you have to have been free from 9:30 until noon on the day of the caucus so you know people are working and there\\'s discussions going on about is there way to improve that.\" Hamburg said much like the caucus in March, there\\'s a record turnout for the state convention. \"We\\'ve not seen a turnout a turnout like this for a state convention, I think certainly in recent memory if not ever,\" Hamburg said. \"There\\'s just a lot of enthusiasm this year and because we have presidential campaigns active in Alaska they are making sure their folks turn out to the state convention.\" Wanda Smith, a delegate from Anchorage said she\\'s seen some differences in the voters who have turned out this year in comparison with 2008. \"We have more younger people that are out, there are more issues they\\'re fired up over the issues they would like to see changed or implemented, they\\'re excited about getting even more younger people to vote on issues that concern them, they seem to be more interested in politics and reality of life and life\\'s issues,\" Smith said. 537 of 539 elected delegates have registered to attend the convention. On Saturday, delegates will participate in the presidential fan out and elect District-Level delegates, party leader and elected official delegates and elect at large delegates along with alternates. In the evening, ADP will host a reception with Democratic National Convention Chair, Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz at the Dena\\'ina Civic & Convention Center. A group of Alaska democrats who say they\\'re not affiliated with any campaign said disagree with the party\\'s leadership at the national level and DNC Chair, Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz\\' treatment of Bernie Sanders supporters. Ed Cullinane, a Sanders supporter is part of a group organizing an alternative event at the Egan Convention Center on Saturday. \"The alternative is about our displeasure with the keynote speaker at the democratic convention dinner after the dinner by the name of Debbie Wasserman Schultz,\" Cullinane said. Hamburg said it\\'s not uncommon to see tension in a contested election year and democrats should celebrate Debbie Wasserman Schultz coming to the state. \"We invited our national committee woman back in February of last year to come to Alaska and she accepted our offer to come and help us this time and we\\'re just really excited that somebody from the national party would come to speak to Alaskans and provide her thoughts and I expect democrats will give her the respect that she deserves,\" Hamburg said. Hamburg said on Friday it\\'s the party\\'s responsibility to remain neutral and he believes democrats will rally behind whoever wins the democratic nomination.

Riled Sanders fans rise up as state Democratic convention begins Alex DeMarban, Alaska Dispatch News Internal strife rocked the Alaska Democratic Party on Friday as it headed into its three-day state convention, with some members of the party that heavily favor Bernie Sanders over Hillary Clinton protesting the convention by planning an alternative event Saturday night. “Alaska voters are an independent people and they don’t want to be told what to do,” said Ed Cullinane, a member of the state central committee from an Anchorage House district. Cullinane helped organize the protest to the convention, where Democrats on Saturday will choose delegates to cast votes at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia in July. Though Clinton appears poised for victory in the hard-fought race, Sanders supporters say he can still claim a win though it would take a surge of delegates. The anti-convention event at the Egan Civic and Convention Center comes because Florida congresswoman and Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz plans to give the keynote speech at the convention in Anchorage Saturday, Cullinane said. Alaskan Democrats gave Sanders 81.6 percent of their support in the March caucus. Many believe Wasserman Schultz has limited debates and unfairly allocated resources to give Clinton a boost, he said. “A lot of us feel that Debbie Wasserman Schultz has displayed very unethical behavior,” he said. At the state convention on Friday afternoon at the UAA Student Union, during an opening day filled with discussions on matters such as Medicaid expansion and climate change, supporters of both Sanders and Clinton said it was important for Alaska Democrats to unite as the national convention approaches. “We all need to be respectful and find common ground,” said Shauna Thornton, a state delegate and “Bernie fan” who hopes to be selected as a national delegate from Alaska on Saturday. Thornton, who is running for a state House seat on the Kenai Peninsula, said she’s not angry Wasserman Schultz is speaking. “She was asked to come over a year ago, so what do you do? So I’ll attend and ask questions about her positions,” Thornton said. Cullinane also launched a petition at MoveOn.org asking the Alaska party to “un-invite” Wasserman Schultz. It had 64 signatures Friday afternoon. He said the anti-convention, which has no official name, will feature a teleconferenced appearance from Tim Canova, Schultz’ Democratic primary opponent in Florida. Plans also include a prerecorded presentation by Jane Sanders’ and a dunk tank with political activist Ray Metcalfe in the wet seat. The event will be held in Summit Hall at the Egan, starting at 6:30 p.m. Wasserman\\'s speech is planned for 8 p.m. Saturday at the Dena\\'ina Civic and Convention Center. She\\'s also scheduled to attend a reception there at 6 p.m. People need to put aside the “divisiveness” said Jennifer Smith, a state convention delegate from a Juneau district who supports Clinton because she’s “cool under fire” and well-versed on critical national issues. “If you want to have an alternative convention then fine, but if you really want to have change in the party structure you should directly address it to (Wasserman Schultz), and not do it through protests,” she said. Alaska Democratic Convention gets underway in Anchorage By Lauren Maxwell, KTVA Alaska At the State Democratic Convention in Anchorage, one of the big jobs party leaders have is to elect delegates to attend the national convention in July, when the presidential nominee will be decided. Back in March, candidate Bernie Sanders won the state’s Democratic caucus in a big way. All 16 of the state’s regular delegates who will go the national convention in Philadelphia are pledged to vote for him. But the state also has four super delegates who can vote for whomever they want. Casey Steinau is one of the super delegates. Steinau is the chairman of the Alaska Democratic Party, but as a super delegate, she’s undeclared. ”I am the chairman of the party and I believe that it is my job to represent 100 percent of the Alaska Democrats and I take that roll very seriously,” Steinau said. “I don’t think my personal preferences should be influencing anyone.” But the idea that super delegates can vote for whomever they want doesn’t sit well with many Democrats. “I think there probably will be a resolution or a platform change or something coming out of this convention which says we don’t necessarily agree with this and we would ask the DNC to reassess it,” Steinau said. Steinau said the resolution might ask to get rid of super delegates altogether or require them to vote for the person who won the state caucus. Meanwhile, Ddemocrats who support Hilary Clinton are also attending the convention. Carolyn Lee with the Hilary for Alaska campaign said there are a lot of people who like both candidates. “We are also getting a lot of Bernie supporters coming up and saying, ‘I’m going to be with Hilary in a couple of weeks but today I’m with Bernie,’” Lee said. Steinau said she was hopeful Alaska Democrats would support whichever candidate wins the Party’s nomination. “They both bring so much to the table and at the end of the day when that person is decided I know that we will come together as a united front.”', 'From: Paustenbach, Mark Sent: Friday, April 29, 2016 7:01 PM To: Miranda, Luis Subject: The Hill - Sanders drops lawsuit against DNC April 29, 2016, 05:14 pm Sanders drops lawsuit against DNC By Ben Kamisar THE HILL Bernie Sanders\\' campaign is dropping its lawsuit against the Democratic National Committee for restricting access to its voter files. The move came Friday after an independent investigation into Democratic presidential campaigns\\' handling of party voter data. The Sanders team said the investigation vindicated them and showed no evidence that they improperly accessed information belonging to Hillary Clinton\\'s campaign. \"An independent investigation of the firewall failures in the DNC’s shared voter file database has definitively confirmed that the original claims by the DNC and the Clinton campaign were wholly inaccurate,\" the campaign said in a statement. \"The Sanders campaign never \\'stole\\' any voter file data; the Sanders campaign never \\'exported\\' any unauthorized voter file data; and the Sanders campaign certainly never had access to the Clinton campaign’s \\'strategic road map.\\' The withdrawal of the lawsuits ends a months-long fight between Sanders and the Democratic party. In December, the DNC alleged that Sanders staffers had improperly accessed Clinton\\'s campaign information. A Sanders aide at the time denied wrongdoing, saying they had only tried to document the security error to alert the DNC. That initial finding prompted the party to briefly block the Sanders campaign\\'s access to party files and data. The Sanders campaign cried foul, accusing the DNC of tipping the scales to help front-runner Clinton less than two months before the Iowa caucuses. The DNC rejected those charges, arguing they were acting to keep campaign data secure. The final results of the investigation on Friday were not made public. But Sanders\\' campaign claimed the investigation showed the unauthorized access came from \"the DNC\\'s security failures\" and that only four campaign staffers, including one who was immediately fired, were aware they could access some of Clinton\\'s data for a one-hour window. The DNC said the investigation confirmed what they first learned. “The forensic analysis conducted by the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike confirmed that the DNC’s initial findings, which were the basis of the temporary shutdown in December, were accurate,\" said DNC communications director Luis Miranda in a statement. \"The audit confirmed that one campaign gained unauthorized access to the data of another, and the audit further confirmed that the results of those searches were saved within the system and that data was exported. Following the conclusion of the audit that confirmed the DNC\\'s original findings, the Sanders campaign withdrew its lawsuit.\" The DNC also provided a timeline that notes that the four Sanders staffers \"conducted 25 searches using proprietary Hillary for America score data across 11 states.\" Both sides acknowledge that one summary sheet with data related to New Hampshire appeared to have been saved off-site, but the Sanders campaign argued that the file did not exist on their computers and was never seen by any Sanders staffer. Sanders sits far behind Hillary Clinton in the delegate count and is effectively unable to steal the lead from her without convincing large numbers of superdelegates to switch their support.', 'Re-added Dem Party “The lessons of the Holocaust are especially important to remember during election season, when the rhetoric of national politics will no doubt get heated.

Clearly the GOP’s problems go well beyond their convention. “In just seven days, Republicans saw their former House Speaker call one of their candidates ‘Lucifer in the flesh,’ watched a desperate, mathematically-eliminated campaign announce a Vice Presidential pick and get ridiculed for it, and then kicked off the Indiana primaries this morning with accusations that Ted Cruz’s father was tied to Lee Harvey Oswald. The absurdity of that last allegation was compounded by the fact that Dangerous Donald Trump, who is just a hair’s-breadth away from securing the Republican nomination, based it on a tabloid story he saw in the National Enquirer. “No wonder the Republican Party is less popular than it’s been in more than two decades. Just today, exit polls in Indiana showed that 53 percent of Indiana primary Republican voters say they feel betrayed by the Republican Party. And in recent weeks, exit polls in primary after primary have shown that a majority of Republican voters believe their primary has been divisive, with as much as a third preferring to either stay home or vote for an alternative, rather than voting for their eventual nominee. “Meanwhile, Democratic voters are proud of their candidates and it shows each time they go to the polls. Last week, in Connecticut and Pennsylvania respectively, 67% and 71% of Democrats reported feeling energized by our primary. Today in Indiana it was three-quarters of Democratic voters who said our primary has energized our party, and a majority of Democrats who voted today expressed support for either one of our candidates. “Today it’s clearer than ever that none of the Republican candidates has the judgment or temperament to serve as our Commander in Chief. The next President of the United States will be nominated at our Democratic convention in Philadelphia.” ### Luis Miranda, Communications Director Democratic National Committee 202-863-8148 – MirandaL@dnc.org - @MiraLuisDC', 'Madam Chair, Nice job on Bloomberg, I thought you handled Nicole’s rapid fire well.

Bernie Sanders on Friday urged Democratic Party Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz not to stack the committees that will draft the rules and lay out the party platform at this summer’s Democratic National Convention. In a letter to the party chairwoman, Sanders said the makeup of the standing committees should reflect the relative level of support that he and Hillary Clinton received in primaries and caucuses. So far, Sanders has won about 45 percent of the pledged delegates. Both campaigns deserve a say at the convention this July in Philadelphia, the senator said. Under party rules, Wasserman Schultz recommends 25 at-large appointments to the party’s executive committee for each of the three standing committees; rules, platform and credentials. Wasserman Schultz has forwarded only three of 40 names the Sanders campaign recommended for the key committees while installing Clinton loyalists in leading roles. Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy was put in charge of the Platform Committee, for example, and former Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts was tapped to head the Rules Committee. Sanders called Malloy and Frank “aggressive attack surrogates” for Clinton. He doubted that either would “conduct committee proceeding in an even-handed manner” and said the appointments of the two Clinton loyalists “suggests the standing committees are being established in an overtly partisan way meant to exclude the input of the voters who have supported my candidacy.” How the party leadership comports itself at the convention will affect Democrats’ chances of winning the general election this November, the Vermont senator said. “If we are to have a unified party in the fall, no matter who wins the nomination, we cannot have a Democratic National Convention in which the views of millions of people who participated in the Democratic nominating process are unrepresented in the committee membership. That sends the very real message that the Democratic Party is not open to the millions of new people that our campaign has brought into the political process, does not want to hear new voices and is unwilling to respect the broader base of people that this party needs to win over in November and beyond,” Sanders wrote to Wasserman Schultz. The letter warned that if committee assignments aren't fairly allotted one result could be floor fights. Under party rules, minority reports may be brought before the full convention at the request of 25 percent of the platform, credentials and rules committees. “If the process is set up to produce an unfair, one-sided result, we are prepared to mobilize our delegates to force as many votes as necessary to amend the platform and rules on the floor of the convention,” Sanders wrote.

Quote: “The suggestion there’s anything unusual about our joint victory funds has no basis in the law or reality. Independent experts like the Election Law Blog have noted that from a legal perspective, the criticisms are ‘weak,’ and both campaigns signed on to similar agreements. While only one campaign is currently using their joint victory fund, we encourage both of our campaigns to identify opportunities to support the national and state Democratic parties now so that we can continue to build the infrastructure to help elect Democrats up and down the ballot in November.” – DNC Communications Director On Background: · The money raised by the joint victory funds, even when the money goes to the DNC, still helps state parties. The funds help strengthen, for example, our national voter file and communications, research and digital support for state parties and down ballot candidates. That includes training across a variety of areas, for example, and access to media monitoring and rapid response support. This is helping the Party right NOW build the infrastructure we need for the general election. · Rick Hasen, an influential academic on campaign finance, posted an analysis on the Election Law Blog that addressed this issue. Hasen states in the article that “it is hard to see what provision of the law” is at issue. As the blog points out, “legally” the criticism of the fund “seems weak.” http://electionlawblog.org/?p=81996 · We welcome any effort by our candidates to help raise money for the DNC and state parties. · Similar agreements were set up with both the Clinton campaign and the Sanders campaign early in the cycle, precisely because of the urgency to build a strong national infrastructure now that will help elect Democrats up and down the ballot in November. The Sanders campaign has not used theirs. · These arrangements are not new or unusual. Similar joint fundraising committees were established with our Democratic candidate in both 2008 and 2012. And again, both campaigns have signed on and have the option of using joint victory funds. · And let’s be clear, neither the DNC nor state parties are subsidizing fundraising through these committees for either campaign. For whatever each campaign raises under the agreement that then goes to their campaign, that campaign pays a directly proportional amount for the cost of that fundraising.

We need to make sure that Sheila or whoever is introducing me, is comfortable with this. But this is what they need to use. Alaska Introduction for DWS 5 minutes Good evening Alaska Democrats!! This has been an incredible convention. I have never seen such enthusiasm in all my years in Democratic politics and it is a testament to both our candidates’ championship for hardworking American families and the reality TV show that has been the Republican nomination process. If there is anything more frightening in this election than President Donald Trump taking the reins at the White House, I don’t know what is. Now, well before the Republicans had a nominee and well before our primary process had even started, our Chair Casey Steinau set her goals high and personally asked DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz to join us in Alaska. That was over a year ago and even with her hectic schedule – being a Mom, Member of Congress, a candidate, and Chair of the national Party – she said YES! Kay [Brown] can tell you how many times we got a call from the DNC and crossed our fingers hoping she wouldn’t have to cancel…and of course not!! Her staff told us time and time again: DWS couldn’t wait to get to Alaska… even though this is her twin’s 17th birthday weekend. We are all very excited for you to hear from the Chairwoman this evening. Since becoming Chair in May 2011, Debbie Wasserman Schultz has traveled to 47 states and participated in nearly 1,800 events for the national and state parties. Now, Debbie Wasserman Schultz is a woman who truly knows how to make it all work. She’s heading back tonight on a redeye so she can cook a birthday dinner for her twins. Before I continue my introduction of Chair Wasserman Schultz, I want to acknowledge a very special guest in the audience. Where is Shelby Schultz? Will everyone join me to give a big Alaska welcome to the Chairwoman’s 12 year old daughter who is making her first trip to Alaska just for this Convention. I hear she’s the adventurous one in the family and had a great time driving up to the mountains for an up close and personal view of one of Alaska’s great treasures – our glaciers. Welcome to Alaska, Shelby! Now, where Debbie Wasserman Schultz’s heart is and the job she cherishes like no other is being a legislator. Debbie has served her constituents in South Florida for nearly 25 years. She was the youngest woman elected to the Florida state legislature - at 26 - and the first Jewish woman elected to the U.S. Congress from the state of Florida. Just ten weeks after taking office in Washington, D.C., she led the fight and stood up to the GOP establishment and President George W. Bush when Congress took action to require Terri Schiavo’s husband to keep her on life support – a complete slap in the face to our constitutional right to privacy and separation of church and state. There is no advocate for women, children, and young families like Debbie Wasserman Schultz. In 2007, she sponsored the Virginia Graeme Baker Pool & Spa Safety Act named after Secretary of State James Baker’s granddaughter who died when she became trapped in a pool drain. Drowning is the number one cause of unintentional death for children under 5 years of age and since this law was passed, there have been NO drownings in the entire country due to entrapments like what happened to Virginia. Next, she teamed up with then Senator Joe Biden to pass the Protect Our Children Act. This bill gave law enforcement the tools and resources they need to track down and prosecute criminals exploiting children online. Even when GOP obstructionist number one, Tom Coburn, held up the bill, Debbie Wasserman Schultz fought tooth and nail to get it passed into law. In 2008, while campaigning for then Senator Barack Obama, she quietly faced her own personal battle with breast cancer. After seven surgeries, winning her own reelection, and electing the first African American President to the White House, she told the world her cancer story by doing what else - holding a press conference to introduce the Education and Awareness Requires Learning Young Act - the EARLY Act. This law provides critical funds and directs the Centers for Disease Control to educate young women and health care providers, that young women in fact can and do get breast cancer and build awareness for those women who are at higher or genetic risk for this disease. Debbie Wasserman Schultz has been a champion for progressive values and working families her entire career. She's used her voice and her vote to support a $15 minimum wage, was a champion for the Affordable Care Act, and is the lead sponsor in Congress to fully fund the Zika virus crisis which is a major health concern in her home state of Florida and across the country. Michelle Obama was right when President Obama nominated her to chair the DNC: “If you want something done, give it to a busy woman.” Well, President Barack Obama found the busiest one out there and named her DNC Chair not once, but TWICE! Thank you for heading to Alaska, Chairwoman Wasserman Schultz! We are so excited to have you here. DWS\"], ['Okay.'], [\"I'll wake up early.

VERSION 1: MEASURED For Immediate Release May 17, 2016 Contact: DNC Press – 202-863-8148 DNC Statement on Nevada Democratic Party Letter WASHINGTON – DNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz today issued the following statement on a letter from the Nevada Democratic Party regarding threatening and violent behavior among some participants around their state party convention this weekend: “We are deeply concerned about the troubling details laid out in the letter from the Nevada Democratic Party. We will be reaching out to the leadership of both of our campaigns to ask them to stand with the Democratic Party in denouncing the type of behavior on display over the weekend in Las Vegas. Our democracy is undermined any time threats, intimidation, physical violence or damage to property are present. If there are legitimate concerns, they must be addressed in an orderly, civil and peaceful manner. “The rules governing the Democratic Party delegate selection process have been in place for decades and the specific procedures for this cycle were agreed upon in 2014. In Nevada on Saturday, the state party’s credentials committee was made up of an equal number of members representing both campaigns. That’s a testament to our party’s fundamental belief in being inclusive, open to the public, and transparent. The process for nominating a Democratic Presidential candidate is not something taken lightly, it is a four-year endeavor that is closely scrutinized and determined in public forums, just as it has been in past election cycles. There is no excuse for what happened in Nevada, and it is incumbent upon all of us in positions of leadership to speak out.” ### VERSION 2: FORTHRIGHT AND THOUGHTFUL For Immediate Release May 17, 2016 Contact: DNC Press – 202-863-8148 DNC Statement on Nevada Democratic Party Letter WASHINGTON – DNC Chair Rep.

The rules governing the Democratic Party delegate selection process have been in place for decades and the specific procedures for this cycle were agreed upon in 2014. In Nevada on Saturday, the state party’s credentials committee was made up of an equal number of members representing both campaigns.

When asked during an interview whether he would disclose his tax rate, Trump snapped at the interviewer and said it was “none of your business.” He also argued that voters do not have a right to see his tax returns before Election Day. Of course, when Trump first considered running for President in 1999, he said he, “probably wouldn’t have a problem with” releasing his tax returns if he ran. Later, in 2012, he argued if you’re running for President, “at a minimum, probably, you’re going to have to show your [tax] returns” and they should be released by April 1st of the election year. Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz issued the following statement: “Trump’s refusal to release his tax returns raises serious questions about what he’s hiding, whether or not he pays his fair share and how much he would benefit from his own reckless tax plan. If Trump can’t be open and honest about his purported wealth today as a candidate, there’s no telling how much he would rig the system to enrich himself and others at the top at the expense of hardworking families as president.”', 'For Immediate Release May 10, 2016 DNC Chair Statement on Tonight’s Primaries in Nebraska and West Virginia “Donald Trump is the Republican Party, and tonight’s primaries didn’t do anything to change that fact. That’s why Republican leaders across the country are tearing out their hair trying to decide between standing with the dangerous and reckless candidate at the top of their ticket, or ditching him and their own upcoming convention in a desperate move to save face. “Today, Ted Cruz refused to throw his support behind Trump, adding his name to the growing list of GOP leaders distancing themselves from the party’s nominee – a list that includes former presidential candidates Mitt Romney and John McCain, and the entire Bush family, who all said they won’t attend their own convention this year. That division at the top is tearing apart the Republican Party all the way down to the grass roots. In exit polls today, just ten percent of Republican voters in West Virginia and three percent in Nebraska said they think their party is united. “By contrast, Democrats are proud of our candidates, who continue to run substantive campaigns worthy of the American people, and who understand that there’s more that unites us than divides us. As we gear up for the general election, we’re doing it with the confidence that our candidates and our party have the right ideas to build on the progress of the last seven years under President Obama. We’ve seen a record 74 straight months of private sector job growth, more than 14 million new jobs, and 20 million people have health care who didn’t before. We must elect a Democrat as our next president to keep America on track.” ### From: Miranda, Luis Sent: Tuesday, May 10, 2016 7:29 PM To: Banfill, Ryan Cc: Paustenbach, Mark Subject: FOR DWS REVIEW: Statement on Primaries For Immediate Release May 10, 2016 DNC Chair Statement on Tonight’s Primaries in Nebraska and West Virginia “Donald Trump is the Republican Party, and tonight’s primaries didn’t do anything to change that fact.

Debbie Wasserman Schultz issued the following statement: “On International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia we reaffirm the dignity and worth of those in the LGBT community. Observing this day is especially important this political season, when negative rhetoric aimed at our LGBT brothers and sisters and efforts to pass anti-LGBT legislation in states around the country threaten to inflame hatreds and deepen divisions in our communities. These actions are wrong, and do nothing but encourage bullying, cruelty and harassment, and we must stand against them. “Our nation has made tremendous strides in the fight for full equality, but we have much farther to go before homophobia, transphobia and biphobia become a thing of the past. Until then, Democrats will continue to openly and proudly fight with the LGBT community, activists and allies to elect leaders and enact policies that advance acceptance and LGBT rights as our common cause.” ###', \"For Immediate Release May 10, 2016 DNC Chair Statement on Tonight’s Primaries in Nebraska and West Virginia “Donald Trump is the Republican Party, and tonight’s primaries didn’t do anything to change that fact. That’s why Republican leaders across the country are tearing out their hair trying to decide between standing with the dangerous and reckless candidate at the top of their ticket, or ditching him and their own upcoming convention in a desperate move to save face. “Today, Ted Cruz refused to throw his support behind Trump, adding his name to the growing list of GOP leaders distancing themselves from the party’s nominee – a list that includes former presidential candidates Mitt Romney and John McCain, and the entire Bush family, who all said they won’t attend their own convention this year. That division at the top is tearing apart the Republican Party all the way down to the grass roots. In exit polls today, just ten percent of Republican voters in West Virginia and three percent in Nebraska said they think their party is united. “By contrast, Democrats are proud of our candidates, who continue to run substantive campaigns worthy of the American people, and who understand that there’s more that unites us than divides us. As we gear up for the general election, we’re doing it with the confidence that our candidates and our party have the right ideas to build on the progress of the last seven years under President Obama. We’ve seen a record 74 straight months of private sector job growth, more than 14 million new jobs, and 20 million people have health care who didn’t before. We must elect a Democrat as our next president to keep America on track.” ### From: Banfill, Ryan Sent: Tuesday, May 10, 2016 7:32 PM To: 'hrtsleeve@gmail.com' Subject: FW: FOR DWS REVIEW: Statement on Primaries For Immediate Release May 10, 2016 DNC Chair Statement on Tonight’s Primaries in Nebraska and West Virginia “Donald Trump is the Republican Party, and tonight’s primaries didn’t do anything to change that fact.

VERSION 1: MEASURED For Immediate Release May 17, 2016 Contact: DNC Press – 202-863-8148 DNC Statement on Nevada Democratic Party Letter WASHINGTON – DNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz today issued the following statement on a letter from the Nevada Democratic Party regarding threatening and violent behavior among some participants around their state party convention this weekend: “We are deeply concerned about the troubling details laid out in the letter from the Nevada Democratic Party. We will be reaching out to the leadership of both of our campaigns to ask them to stand with the Democratic Party in denouncing the type of behavior on display over the weekend in Las Vegas. Our democracy is undermined any time threats, intimidation, physical violence or damage to property are present. If there are legitimate concerns, they must be addressed in an orderly, civil and peaceful manner. “The rules governing the Democratic Party delegate selection process have been in place for decades and the specific procedures for this cycle were agreed upon in 2014. In Nevada on Saturday, the state party’s credentials committee was made up of an equal number of members representing both campaigns. That’s a testament to our party’s fundamental belief in being inclusive, open to the public, and transparent. The process for nominating a Democratic Presidential candidate is not something taken lightly, it is a four-year endeavor that is closely scrutinized and determined in public forums, just as it has been in past election cycles. There is no excuse for what happened in Nevada, and it is incumbent upon all of us in positions of leadership to speak out.” ### VERSION 2: FORTHRIGHT AND THOUGHTFUL For Immediate Release May 17, 2016 Contact: DNC Press – 202-863-8148 DNC Statement on Nevada Democratic Party Letter WASHINGTON – DNC Chair Rep.
